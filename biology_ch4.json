  "Diseases are the result of some disturbance in the normal life process of the plant",
  "Diseases may be the result of living and/or non-living causes",
  "Biotic diseases are caused by living organisms (e.g., fungi, bacteria, and viruses)",
  "Abiotic diseases are caused by non-living environmental conditions (e.g., soil compaction, wind, frost, soil salt damage, and girdling roots)",
  "Plant disease is any abnormal condition that alters the appearance or function of a plant",
  "It is a physiological process that affects some or all plant functions",
  "Disease may also reduce yield and quality of harvested product",
  "Most plant diseases, around 85 percent are caused by fungal or fungal-like organisms",
  "However, other serious diseases of food and feed crops are caused by viral and bacterial organisms",
  "Certain nematodes also cause plant diseases",
  "Nematodes are very tiny roundworms",
  "They are plant parasites and help distribute bacteria and fungi through the soil as well as along roots",
  "Some plant diseases are classified as \"abiotic,\" or diseases that are non- infectious and include damage from air pollution, nutritional deficiencies or toxicities, and grow under less than optimal conditions",
  "Infectious plant diseases are caused by a pathogenic organism such as a fungus, bacterium, mycoplasma, virus, viroid, nematode, or parasitic flowering plant",
  "An infectious agent is capable of reproducing within or on its host and spreading from one susceptible host to another",
  "Non-infectious plant diseases are caused by unfavourable growing conditions, including extremes of temperature, disadvantageous relationships between moisture and oxygen, toxic substances in the soil or atmosphere, and an excess or deficiency of an essential mineral",
  "Because non-infectious causal agents are not organisms capable of reproducing within a host, they are not transmissible",
  "The study of plant diseases is called plant pathology",
  "Pathology is derived from the two Greek words pathos (suffering, disease) and logos (discourse, study)",
  "Plant pathology thus means a study of plant diseases",
  "Plant disease is caused by a pathogen (biotic or infectious disease) or an environmental factor (abiotic or non-infectious disease)",
  "Biotic diseases can spread throughout one plant and also may spread to neighbouring plants of the same species",
  "These include biotic problems caused by living organisms such as pathogens, nematodes, insects and other arthropods",
  "Biotic diseases sometimes show physical evidence (signs) of the pathogen, such as fungal growth, bacterial ooze, or nematode cysts, or the presence of mites or insects",
  "Many plant problems, especially biotic problems, if not recognized and controlled early in their development, they can result in significant economic damage for the producer",
  "Therefore, timely and accurate diagnoses are required so that appropriate pest and disease management options and other corrective measures can be implemented",
  "Abiotic diseases are caused by nonliving factors, such as drought stress, sunscald, freeze injury, wind injury, chemical injury, nutrient deficiency, or improper cultural practices, such as overwatering or planting conditions",
  "These diseases are caused by conditions external to the plant, not due to living agents",
  "They cannot spread from plant to plant but are very common and should be considered when assessing the health of any plant",
  "Examples of abiotic disease include nutritional deficiencies, soil compaction, salt injury, ice, and sun scorch",
  "Abiotic damage often occurs on many plant species",
  "Drought stress or chemical injury will likely cause damage on several types of plants",
  "In contrast, biotic disease problems are more limited to a certain species",
  "For example, the fungi that cause tomato leaf blight do not cause damage on sweet corn",
  "Abiotic damage does not spread from plant to plant over time",
  "Abiotic diseases do not show the presence of disease signs",
  "Plant diseases are their occurrence and severity result from the impact of three factors",
  "They are the host plant, the pathogen and the environmental conditions",
  "Signs can also help with plant disease identification",
  "Signs are the actual organisms causing the disease",
  "Any detectable changes in colour, shape, and/or functions of the plant in response to a pathogen or disease-causing agent is a symptom",
  "Symptoms of disease are the plant's reaction to the causal agent",
  "Because viruses are systemic, infected plants must be rogued or discarded",
  "For example, common virus diseases in Colorado include curly top virus of tomatoes, cucumber mosaic virus in tomatoes and vine crops, tomato spotted wilt virus, and a variety of greenhouse plant viruses",
  "Curly top virus  Cucumber mosaic virus  Tomato spotted wilt virus Types of Pathogens 4.1.3 4.1.3 Types of Pathogens  Plant pathogens are very similar to those that cause disease in humans and animals",
  "Infectious plant diseases are caused by living organisms that attack and obtain their nutrition from the plant they infect",
  "The parasitic organism that causes a disease is a pathogen",
  "Pathogens can spread from plant to plant and may infect all types of plant tissues including leaves, shoots, stems, crown, roots, tubers, fruits, seeds and vascular tissues",
  "Groups of plant pathogens - fungi  Fungi and fungal-like organisms (FLOs) cause more plant diseases than any other group of plant pest with over 8,000 species shown to cause disease",
  "FLOs are organisms like Pythium and Phytophthora and cause downy mildew",
  "All plants are attacked by one species or another of phytopathogenic fungi",
  "Individual species of fungi can parasitize one or many different kinds of plants",
  "Most pathogenic fungi belong to the following genera: Alternaria, Aspergillus, Botrytis, Fusarium, Puccinia, Rhizopus, and Sclerotinia",
  "Leaf spots and blight Rots of seeds  Blights Root rot Rust of cereals  Soft rot of fruits  Soft rot of vegetables Groups of plant pathogens - bacteria  Not all bacteria are bad for plants and soil",
  "In fact, most are beneficial",
  "However, there are approximately 200 types of bacteria that cause diseases in plants",
  "They are most active in warm and humid environments",
  "Bacteria that cause plant diseases are spread in many ways",
  "They can be splashed about by rain or carried by the wind, birds or insects",
  "Most plant pathogenic bacteria belong to the following genera: Agrobacterium, Erwinia, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces and Xanthomonas",
  "They cause human and animal diseases such as influenza, polio, rabies, smallpox, and warts",
  "Unlike bacteria and fungi, viruses are not spread by water or wind",
  "Instead, they must physically enter the plant",
  "One of the most common vectors of viruses are insects",
  "Examples of some viruses are tobacco mosaic, tomato mosaic, barley yellow dwarf, potato leaf roll, tomato spotted wilt, and tobacco ringspot",
  "Tobacco mosaic Tomato mosaic Barley yellow dwarf Potato leaf roll Tomato spotted wilt Tobacco ringspot  Mosaics are characterized by the formation of light green, yellow, or white spots intermingled with the normal green aerial plant structures",
  "Ringspots are characterized by the appearance of chlorotic or necrotic rings on the leaves",
  "These primary symptoms may be accompanied by a variety of other symptoms in specific viral plant diseases",
  "Nematodes are simple, multicellular animals and are bilaterally symmetrical, soft-bodied (no skeleton), non-segmented roundworms",
  "Most nematode species that attack plants are microscopic",
  "A number of genera and species of nematodes are highly damaging to a great range of hosts, including foliage plants, agronomic and vegetable crops, fruit and nut trees",
  "Plant parasitic nematodes have a stylet, a piercing mouthpart",
  "The presence of a stylet is the key diagnostic sign differentiating plant parasitic nematodes from all other types of nematodes",
  "Based on the plant part, the nematode invaded can be classified into wheat nematode: Anguina tritici, spring dwarf nematode: Aphelenchoides fragariae, Stubby- root nematodes: Trichodorus sp., and root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp",
  "Wheat Spring dwarf Stubby- root Root-knot Control of Plant Diseases 4.1.4 4.1.4 Control of Plant Diseases  Plant diseases caused by infectious pathogens have seriously affected human society and nature through their damages to food production, economic development",
  "It is need to be controlled to maintain the quality and abundance of food, feed, and fibre produced by growers around the world",
  "To prevent, mitigate or control plant diseases, different approaches can be used",
  "There are three plant diseases control approaches: biological, physical and chemical",
  "Biological control  Biological control is control of plant diseases using living microorganisms",
  "Four main mechanisms involved in the biocontrol are  (i)the biological agent (antagonist) may parasite the other organism,  (ii)antagonist may secrete metabolites (antibiotics) harmful to the pathogens (antibiosis)  (iii)antagonist may compete with the pathogens for nutrients or space (competition) and  (iv)may cause death of the parasite by producing enzymes (lysis)",
  "Physical control  Physical methods of disease prevention and control are based on the physiological tolerance of disease agents to adverse conditions such as high or low temperature, absence of moisture, presence of deleterious irradiation and the removal of pathogen sources or presence of physical barriers to prevent contact between the disease agent and the host",
  "Chemical control  A variety of chemicals are available that have been designed to control plant diseases by inhibiting the growth or by killing the disease-causing pathogens",
  "Chemicals used to control bacteria (bactericides), fungi (fungicides), and nematodes (nematicides) may be applied to seeds, foliage, flowers, fruit, or soil",
  "ANIMAL DISEASES 4.2 4.2 ANIMAL DISEASES  A disease is an illness or disorder of the body or mind that leads to poor health; each disease is associated with a set of signs and symptoms",
  "All animals, including human, suffer from one kind of disease or another during their lifespan",
  "Animal diseases can be divided into non-infectious diseases and infectious diseases",
  "4.2.1 Non-infectious Diseases 4.2.1 Non-infectious Diseases  Non-infectious diseases are those that are not caused by pathogens, so that they cannot spread from one person to another",
  "In fact, they are caused by factors such as aging, genetics, malnutrition, lifestyle and environment",
  "Examples of non-infectious diseases include cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's",
  "Cardiovascular disease (CVD)  Most cardiovascular disease starts with atheroma formation",
  "If the endothelium, the inner lining of the wall of the artery, is damaged by high blood pressure, an inflammatory response where by white blood cells (mostly macrophages) move into the area",
  "These white blood cells and lipids from the blood clump together under the endothelium to form fatty streaks",
  "Overtime, more white blood cells, lipids and connective tissue build up and harden to form a fibrous plaque called atheroma",
  "This plaque partially blocks the lumen of the artery and restricts blood flow, which causes blood pressure to increase",
  "The hardening of arteries, caused by atheroma, is called atherosclerosis ",
  "In angina, plaques build up slowly in the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the parts of the heart muscle beyond the plaques",
  "Often symptoms are first noticed during exercise, when the cardiac muscle is working harder and needs more oxygen",
  "The narrowed coronary arteries cannot supply enough oxygenated blood and the heart muscle resorts to anaerobic respiration",
  "This causes a gripping pain in the chest that can extend into the arms, particularly the left one, and the jaw, and often also causes breathlessness",
  "The symptoms of angina subside once exercise stops, but the experience is painful and frightening ",
  "Oxygen is supplied to the heart muscle by the coronary arteries",
  "If the coronary artery becomes completely blocked by a blood clot, an area of the heart muscle will be totally cut off from its blood supply and will not receive any oxygen",
  "This causes myocardial infarction, more commonly known as a heart attack, due to damage and death of the heart muscle",
  "Symptoms include pain in the chest as in angina and upper body, shortness of breath and sweating",
  "If large areas of the heart are affected, complete heart failure can occur",
  "Death may be instantaneous without any previous symptoms or may happen after several days of feeling tired and suffering symptoms mistaken for indigestion ",
  "A stroke is caused by an interruption to the normal blood supply to an area of the brain",
  "This may be due to bleeding from damaged capillaries or a blockage cutting off the blood supply to the brain",
  "A blockage is usually caused by a blood clot, an atheroma or a combination of the two",
  "Sometimes, the blood clot forms somewhere else in the body and is carried in the bloodstream until it gets stuck, blocking an artery in the brain",
  "The damage happens very quickly",
  "A blockage in one of the main arteries leading to the brain causes a very serious stroke that may lead to death",
  "If it happens in one of the smaller arterioles the effects may be less disastrous",
  "The symptoms of strokes vary, depending on how much of the brain is affected",
  "Very often, the blood is cut off from one part or one side of the brain only",
  "Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision or partial loss of vision (usually one eye) and numbness",
  "In more severe strokes, there can be paralysis, usually on one side of the body",
  "Stroke due to blockage of blood clot (thrombus) and rupture of blood vessel Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a blood clot in a vein deep inside the body and it usually happens in leg veins",
  "It can be caused by prolong inactivity such as during long-haul flights, and the risk increased with age",
  "4.2.1 Non-infectious Diseases Risk factor for cardiovascular disease  The risk factors may be non-modifiable or modifiable",
  "Non-modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease                The three main risk factors for CVDs which cannot be changed are: Genes: there is a genetic tendency (trend) in some families, and also in some ethnic groups, to develop CVDs",
  "These trends can include  (i)arteries which are easily damaged,  (ii)a tendency to develop hypertension which can cause arterial damage and make CVDs more likely, and  (iii)problems with the cholesterol balance of the body",
  "Age: as a person gets older, the blood vessels begin to lose their elasticity and to narrow slightly",
  "This can make more likely to suffer from CVDs, particularly heart disease",
  "Gender: men are more likely to suffer from heart disease (and other CVDs) than women",
  "Modifiable risks factors for cardiovascular disease            The development of atherosclerosis is linked to many types of CVD",
  "Lifestyle can affect the risk of developing atherosclerosis in the future",
  "Epidemiological studies have shown links with smoking, diet and weight, lack of activity and high blood pressure",
  "Smoking - Studies have shown that smokers are far more likely to develop atherosclerosis than non-smokers with a similar lifestyle",
  "Studies found that the substances in tobacco smoke:  (i)can damage the artery linings, which makes the build-up of plaques more likely,  (ii)can cause the arteries to narrow, raise the blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, and  (iii)smoking also changes the balance of lipoproteins in the blood",
  "Inactivity - Sedentary lifestyle can lead to heart diseases",
  "It also causes obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes",
  "Regular exercise helps to prevent these adverse health effects",
  "It also lowers blood cholesterol levels, balance lipoproteins and reduce stress",
  "And thus, lower the risk of developing atherosclerosis and CVDs",
  "High blood pressure - A healthy blood pressure is around 120 mmHg during systole and around 80 mmHg during diastole",
  "If the blood pressure is regularly above 140/90 mmHg, it is a sign of high blood pressure or hypertension and can also be a sign of atherosclerosis",
  "The blood pressure goes up when the walls of the arteries become less flexible due to the build-up of the plaques",
  "This means that raised blood pressure can be the result of atherosclerosis",
  "Measuring blood pressure is used as an indicator of both the heart and blood vessels",
  "Diet and obesity - An increasing number of studies suggest that being overweight does not directly affect the risk of developing CVDs, but it is a very important indicator of risk",
  "Most scientists think that the best predictors of future CVDs are:  (i)where fat is stored on the body,  (ii)how much exercise a person does and  (iii)the levels of different fats in the blood",
  "Two other factors which are often a direct result of being overweight do increase the risk of atherosclerosis and CVDs",
  "These are: high blood pressure which increases the risk of damage to blood vessel linings, and so of plaque formation type 2 diabetes- this can result in damage to the lining of the blood vessels which increases the risk of plaque formation",
  "Many studies are starting to find that an increased risk of developing a disease is often due to a combination of factors",
  "Prevention of cardiovascular disease  Eating a balanced diet with a variety of fats and plenty of fruit and vegetables helps prevent atherosclerosis",
  "Not smoking and maintaining a healthy weight- a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5- 25 kgm−2 is the ideal range",
  "It is needed to control high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes",
  "Taking regular exercise strengthens the heart muscle and helps to control blood pressure and cholesterol level",
  "It also reduces constant stress",
  "Thus, all these factors contribute towards the prevention of cardiovascular disease",
  "Treatment  Antihypertensives drugs that such as beta blockers, sympathetic nerve inhibitors, ACE inhibitors are some of the commonly prescribed drugs to reduce blood pressure",
  "They reduce the risks of CVDs and also reduce the risk of damage to the kidneys and eyes from high blood pressure",
  "But there are risks",
  "If the treatment is not monitored carefully, the blood pressure may become too low",
  "That can lead to falls and injuries which, particularly in elderly patients, can be serious and even life-threatening",
  "To lower the level of cholesterol in the blood, a group of drugs known as statin is used",
  "They also improve the balance of LDLs (low-density lipoprotein) to HDLs (high-density lipoprotein) and reduce inflammation in the lining of the arteries",
  "Both functions reduce the risk of atherosclerosis developing",
  "Plant stanols and sterols compounds are now widely sold in spreads and yoghurts, which also reduce the levels of LDLs in the blood",
  "Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin and heparin) are a class of medicines used to reduce blood clotting",
  "Platelet inhibitory drugs such as aspirin are also a type of anticoagulant",
  "These drugs prevent platelets clumping together",
  "As they reduce the formation of blood clots, the chance of a blood vessel becoming blockage can be reduced",
  "Infectious Diseases 4.2.2 4.2.2 Infectious Diseases  Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by organisms known as pathogens",
  "They are sometimes called communicable diseases as they are passed from infected to uninfected people",
  "Some also affect animals and are passed from animals to humans",
  "The way in which a pathogen passes from one host to another is called the transmission cycle",
  "Malaria Transmission Cycle The prevalence of a disease is the number of people who have that disease at any one time",
  "Diseases that are always in populations are described as endemic",
  "An epidemic occurs when there is a sudden increase in the number of people with a disease",
  "A pandemic occurs when there is an increase in the number of cases throughout a continent or across the world",
  "The death rate from different diseases is referred to as mortality",
  "Most cases of malaria are caused by one of four species of the protist Plasmodium.",
  "Genetic analysis of infections shows that some species of Plasmodium that cause malaria in monkeys also affect humans",
  "If the person they bite is infected with Plasmodium, they will take up some of the pathogen's gametes with the blood meal",
  "Male and female gametes fuse in the mosquito's gut and develop to form infective stages, which move to the mosquito's salivary glands",
  "When the mosquito feeds again, it injects an anticoagulant from its salivary glands that prevents the blood meal from clotting, so that it flows out of the host into the mosquito",
  "The infective stages pass from the mosquito's salivary glands into the human's blood together with the anticoagulant in the saliva",
  "The parasites enter the red blood cells, where they multiply",
  "The female Anopheles mosquito is therefore a vector of malaria and it transmits the disease when it passes the infective stages into an uninfected person",
  "Malaria may also be transmitted during blood transfusion and when unsterile needles are re-used",
  "Plasmodium can also pass across the placenta from mother to fetus",
  "Plasmodium multiplies in both hosts, the human and the mosquito; at each stage there is a huge increase in the number of parasites, and this improves the chances of infecting another mosquito or human host",
  "If people are continually re-infected by different strains of malaria they become immune",
  "However, this only happens if they survive the first five years of life, when mortality from malaria is very high",
  "The immunity only lasts as long as people are in contact with the disease",
  "This explains why epidemics in places where malaria is not endemic can be very serious, and why malaria is more dangerous in those areas where it only occurs during and after the rainy season",
  "This often coincides with the time of maximum agricultural activity, so the disease has a disastrous effect on the economy: people cannot cultivate the land when they are sick",
  "Treating malaria  Quinine and chloroquine are anti-malarial drugs used to treat infected people",
  "They are also used as prophylactic (preventative) drugs, stopping an infection occurring if a person is bitten by an infected mosquito",
  "Prophylactic drugs are taken before, during and after visiting an area where malaria is endemic",
  "Chloroquine inhibits protein synthesis and prevents the parasite spreading within the body",
  "Proguanil is another prophylactic, has the added advantage of inhibiting the sexual reproduction of Plasmodium inside the biting mosquito",
  "Where anti-malarial drugs have been used widely, there are strains of drug-resistant Plasmodium - the drug is no longer effective against the pathogen",
  "Mefloquine is a new drug used in South America, Africa and New Guinea",
  "However, mefloquine is expensive and sometimes causes unpleasant side-effects such as restlessness, dizziness, vomiting and disturbed sleep",
  "Resistance to mefloquine has developed in some areas, notably the border regions of Thailand",
  "The antibiotic doxycycline is also used as a prophylactic drug",
  "Artesunate, a drug derived from the plant compound artemisinin, is used in combination with mefloquine to treat infections of P",
  "Preventing malaria  There are three main ways to control malaria: reduce the number of mosquitoes, avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and use drugs to prevent the parasite infecting people",
  "It is possible to kill the insect vector and break the transmission cycle",
  "Mosquitoes lay their eggs in water",
  "Larvae hatch and develop in water but breathe air by coming to the surface",
  "Oil can be spread over the surfaces of water to make it impossible for mosquito larvae and pupae to breathe",
  "Marshes can be drained and vegetation cleared",
  "Two biological control measures that can be used are: stocking ponds, irrigation and drainage ditches and other permanent bodies of water with fish which feed on mosquito larvae e.g., mosquito fish Gambusia affinis spraying a preparation containing the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, which kills mosquito larvae but is not toxic to other forms of life However, mosquitoes will lay their eggs in any small puddle or pool, which makes it impossible to completely eradicate breeding sites, especially in the rainy season",
  "The best protection against malaria is to avoid being bitten",
  "People are advised to sleep beneath mosquito nets and use insect repellents",
  "Soaking mosquito nets in insecticide every six months has been shown to reduce mortality from malaria",
  "People should not expose their skin when mosquitoes are active at dusk",
  "Worldwide control of malaria  In the 1950s, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated a worldwide eradication programme",
  "Although malaria was cleared from some countries, the programme was not generally successful",
  "There were two main reasons for this: Plasmodium became resistant to the drugs used to control it mosquitoes became resistant to dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and the other insecticides that were used at the time, such as dieldrin The reasons for the worldwide concern over the spread of malaria are: an increase in drug-resistant forms of Plasmodium an increase in the proportion of cases caused by P falciparum, the form that causes severe, often fatal malaria difficulties in developing vaccines against malaria an increase in the number of epidemics, because of climatic and environmental changes that favour the spread of mosquitoes the migration of people from areas where malaria is endemic, for economic and political reasons Malaria is still one of the world's biggest threats to health: 40% of the world's population lives in areas where there is a risk of malaria",
  "Between 2000 and 2011, control measures have achieved a decrease in mortality rates of about 25% across the world, and 33% in the WHO's African region",
  "Control methods now concentrate on working within the health systems to improve diagnosis, improve the supply of effective drugs and promote appropriate methods to prevent transmission",
  "Several recent advances give hope that malaria may one day be controlled",
  "The introduction of simple dip stick tests for diagnosing malaria means that diagnosis can be done quickly without the need for laboratories",
  "The whole genome of Plasmodium has been sequenced, and this may lead to the development of effective vaccines",
  "Several vaccines are being trialed, but it is not likely that a successful vaccine will be available for some time",
  "Drugs are used in combination to reduce the chances of drug resistance arising",
  "Three factors may lead to improvements in the control of malaria: use of modern techniques in gene sequencing and drug design development of vaccines targeted against different stages of the parasite's life cycle and a renewed international will to remove the burden of disease from the poorest parts of the world, allied to generous donations from wealthy individuals and foundations"
