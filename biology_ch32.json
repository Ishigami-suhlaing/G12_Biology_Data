  "There are two main types of circulatory system; open circulatory system and closed circulatory system",
  "Open circulatory system - Blood pumped by the tubular heart leaves the open-ended vessels to a series of blood spaces surrounding the tissues",
  "When the heart relaxes, the blood flows back into the vessels through pores called ostia",
  "This type is found in most arthropods (jointed leg animals such as insects, spiders and crabs) ",
  "Closed circulatory system- Blood is pumped by the heart into the blood vessels which carry the blood to the tissues of the entire body",
  "Then, the blood from the tissues is carried back to the heart by the blood vessels",
  "The main advantages of a closed system are-  (i)the pressure can be increased to make the blood flow more quickly and  (ii)the flow can be directed more precisely to the organs that need most oxygen and nutrients",
  "There are two types of closed circulatory system; single circulatory system and double circulatory system",
  "Single circulatory system - It is found in fish",
  "The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the gills, the organs of gas exchange where the blood takes in oxygen (becomes oxygenated) and gives up carbon dioxide at the same time",
  "The blood then travels on around the rest of the body of the fish, giving up oxygen to the body cells before returning to the heart",
  "In this type, blood passes once through the heart ",
  "Double circulatory system - Birds and mammals have evolved the most complex type of transport system, known as a double circulatory system because it involves two separate circulations",
  "The systemic circulation carries oxygenated blood (oxygen-rich blood) from the heart to the cells of the body where the oxygen is used",
  "It also carries the deoxygenated blood (blood that has given up its oxygen to the body cells) back to the heart",
  "The pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs to be oxygenated and then carries the oxygenated blood back to the heart",
  "Thus, blood passes twice through the heart",
  "Birds and mammals need much more oxygen than fish",
  "Not only do they have to move around without the support of water, but they also maintain a constant body temperature that may be higher or lower than their surroundings",
  "This takes a lot of resources, so their cells need plenty of oxygen and glucose and make waste products that need to be removed quickly ",
  "Poikilotherms – “cold-blooded” animals Body temperature tracks environmental temperature",
  "Homeotherms- “warm-blooded” animals Heat production/loss is controlled: Set Point   Have you ever seen chicken are searching the whole day?",
  "The advantages of double circulation are: (i)The separate circuits of a double circulatory system ensure that the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix, so the tissues receive as much oxygen as possible",
  "(ii)The fully oxygenated blood can be delivered quickly to the body tissues at high pressure",
  "(iii) The blood going through the tiny blood vessels in the lungs is at relatively low pressure, so it does not damage the vessels and allows gas exchange to take place",
  "(iv) When the oxygenated blood returns to the heart, it can be pumped hard and sent around the body at high pressure",
  "This means it reaches all the tiny capillaries between the body cells quickly, supplying oxygen for an active way of life",
  "In mammals, the cardiovascular system delivers the materials needed by the cells of the body, and carries away the waste products of their metabolism",
  "The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart - which acts as a pump to move blood through the vessels, a series of blood vessels - which carry blood and the blood - as transport medium",
  "The passage of blood through the vessels is called the circulation",
  "The human heart, like other mammalian hearts, is a muscular pump with four chambers",
  "The upper two chambers are called the right atrium and the left atrium",
  "The lower chambers are the right ventricle and the left ventricle",
  "Both sides of the heart work simultaneously",
  "The walls of the atria are thinner than those of the ventricles",
  "The right atrium receives the blood from the superior vena cava which collects deoxygenated blood from the head, neck, arms and chest, and from the inferior vena cava which receives deoxygenated blood from the lower parts of the body",
  "The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via pulmonary veins",
  "After the blood enters into both ventricles from the corresponding atrium, the deoxygenated blood in right ventricle enters the lungs through pulmonary artery",
  "The oxygenated blood in the left ventricle enters into aorta and then passes throughout the body",
  "As the two sides are separated by a complete thick, muscular septum, the blood in one side of the heart does not mix with the blood from the other side",
  "The heart is made of a unique type of muscle, known as cardiac muscle, which has special properties, it can carry on contracting regularly without resting or getting fatigued",
  "Cardiac muscle has a good blood supply by the coronary arteries bringing oxygenated blood while coronary veins carry away the deoxygenated blood",
  "It also contains lots of myoglobin, a respiratory pigment which has a stronger affinity for oxygen than haemoglobin",
  "The muscular wall of the left ventricle is much thicker than that of the right",
  "The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, which are relatively close to the heart",
  "The delicate capillaries of the lungs need blood delivered at relatively low pressure",
  "The left ventricle must produce sufficient force to move the blood under pressure to all the extremities of the body and overcome the elastic recoil of the arteries ",
  "There are four sets of valves in the heart; two sets of atrioventricular valves and two sets of semilunar valves",
  "The right atrioventricular valve is called tricuspid valves which is made up of three flaps and is located between the right atrium and right ventricle",
  "The function of the tricuspid valve is prevention of backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium",
  "The left atrioventricular valve is called bicuspid valve (Mitral valve) which is made up of two flaps and is located between the left atrium and left ventricle",
  "Its function is prevention of backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium",
  "The flaps of both atrioventricular valves are supported by the cordae tendineae (tendinous cords) which prevent the flaps from turning inside out by the pressure exerted when the ventricles contract",
  "Semilunar valves (semi means half and lunar means moon) - Both are pocket-like valves with half-moon shaped like those in veins",
  "One set is located at the base of the pulmonary artery while the other set is at the base of the aorta and their function is prevention of backflow of blood from the pulmonary artery into the right ventricle and from the aorta into the left ventricle, respectively",
  "The main types of blood vessel; the arteries, veins and capillaries have very different characteristics",
  "These affect the way the blood flows through the body, and what the vessels do in the body",
  "Arteries  Arteries carry blood away from the heart towards the cells of the body",
  "Almost all arteries carry oxygenated blood",
  "The exceptions are: the pulmonary artery - carrying deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs and the umbilical artery during pregnancy, this carries deoxygenated blood from the foetus to the placenta",
  "The aorta (large artery) leaving the heart branches off into arteries in every direction, and the diameter of the lumen, the central space inside the blood vessel, gets smaller the further away it is from the heart",
  "The very smallest branches of the arterial system, furthest from the heart, are the arterioles",
  "The major arteries close to the heart must withstand pressure surges",
  "Their walls contain a lot of elastic fibers so they can stretch to accommodate the greater volume of blood without being damaged",
  "Between surges, the elastic fibers return to their original length, squeezing the blood to move it along in a continuous flow",
  "The role of the elastic fibers in artery walls is to return to their original length to help maintain the pressure",
  "This is called recoil",
  "The elastic recoil does not help to increase pressure, it simply helps to maintain the pressure",
  "A thick muscular wall helps control the flow of blood by dilating (widening) or constricting (narrowing) the vessels",
  "Veins carry blood back towards the heart",
  "Most veins carry deoxygenated blood",
  "The exceptions are: the pulmonary vein, carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs back to the heart for circulation around the body and the umbilical vein, carries oxygenated blood from the placenta into the foetus, during pregnancy",
  "Tiny venules lead from the capillary network, combining into larger and larger vessels going back to the heart as vena cava (large vein)",
  "Veins can hold a large volume of blood, in fact more than half of the body's blood volume is in the veins at any one time",
  "They act as a blood reservoir",
  "The blood pressure in the veins is relatively low and the pressure surges from the heart are eliminated before the blood reaches the capillary system",
  "This blood at low pressure must be returned to the heart and lungs to be oxygenated again and recirculated",
  "The walls of the veins are thinner than those of the arteries and contain less elastic tissue and muscle ",
  "There are one-way valves at frequent intervals throughout the venous system",
  "These are called semilunar valves because of their half-moon shape",
  "They develop from enfolding's of the inner wall of the vein",
  "Blood can pass through towards the heart, but if it starts to flow backwards the valves close, preventing any backflow",
  "The contraction of large muscles encourages blood flow through the veins ",
  "Capillaries have a very simple structure which is well adapted to their function",
  "Their walls are very thin and contain no elastic fibers, smooth muscle or collagen",
  "This helps them fit between individual cells and allows rapid diffusion of substances between the blood and the cells",
  "The walls consist of just one very thin cell",
  "Oxygen and other molecules, such as digested food molecules and hormones, quickly diffuse out of the blood in the capillaries into the nearby body cells, and carbon dioxide and other waste molecules diffuse into the capillaries",
  "Blood entering the capillary network from the arteries is oxygenated",
  "When it leaves, it carries less oxygen and more carbon dioxide ",
  "The blood is composed of the plasma, blood cells, which are erythrocytes (red blood cells) and several types of leucocytes (white blood cells), and platelets",
  "Plasma  Plasma is the liquid part of the blood",
  "Over 50% of the blood volume in the body is plasma, and it carries all of blood cells and everything else that needs transporting around the body",
  "This includes: (i)digested food products (e.g., glucose and amino acids) from the small intestine to the liver and then to all the parts of the body where they are needed either for immediate use or for storage, (ii)nutrient molecules from storage areas to the cells that need them, (iii) excretory products (e.g., carbon dioxide and urea) from cells to the excretory organs such as the lungs or kidneys, to be excreted from the body,  (iv) chemical messages (hormones) from where they are made to the target organs in the body,  (v)carries heat around the system from internal organs (e.g., the gut) or very active tissues (e.g., leg muscles in someone running) to the skin, where it can be lost to the surroundings,  (vi) also acts as a buffer to regulate pH changes",
  "Erythrocytes or red blood cells  There are approximately  million erythrocytes per 𝐦𝐦 of blood (- million per 𝐦𝐦 in women, - million per 𝐦𝐦 in men)",
  "They contain haemoglobin, a red pigment that carries oxygen and gives them their colour",
  "They are made in the bone marrow",
  "Mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus and have a limited life of about  days",
  "The erythrocytes transport oxygen from the lungs to all the cells",
  "They are well adapted for their function",
  "The biconcave disc shape of the cells means that they have a large surface area to volume ratio, so oxygen can diffuse into and out of them rapidly",
  "Having no nucleus leaves much more space inside the cells for the haemoglobin molecules that carry the oxygen",
  "In fact, each red blood cell contains around - million molecules of haemoglobin and can carry approximately  million molecules of oxygen",
  "Haemoglobin also carries some of the carbon dioxide produced in respiration back to the lungs",
  "The rest is transported in the plasma ",
  "Leucocytes or white blood cells  They are much larger than erythrocytes but can also squeeze through tiny blood vessels because they can change their shape",
  "There are around , - , per 𝐦𝐦 of blood and there are several different types",
  "They are made in the bone marrow, although some mature in the thymus gland",
  "Their main function is to defend the body against infection",
  "Leucocytes are also very important in the inflammatory response of the body when an area of tissue is damaged",
  "They all contain a nucleus and have colourless cytoplasm, although some types contain granules which can be stained ",
  "Platelets  Platelets are tiny fragments of large cells called megakaryocytes, which are found in the bone marrow",
  "There are about ,-, platelets per 𝐦𝐦 of blood",
  "They are involved in blood clotting ",
  "The body has a limited volume of blood",
  "In theory, a minor cut could endanger life as the torn blood vessels allow blood to escape",
  "First, the blood volume will reduce and if too much blood losses, you will die",
  "Second, pathogens can get into the body through an open wound",
  "In normal circumstances, the body protects through the clotting mechanism of the blood",
  "This mechanism seals damaged blood vessels to minimize blood loss and prevent pathogens getting in",
  "Plasma, blood cells and platelets flow from a cut vessel",
  "Contact between the platelets and components of the tissue (e.g., collagen fibres in the skin) causes the platelets to break open in large numbers",
  "They release several substances, two of which are particularly important",
  "Serotonin causes the smooth muscle of the blood vessel to contract",
  "This narrows the blood vessels, cutting off the blood flow to the damaged area",
  "Thromboplastin is an enzyme that starts a sequence of chemical changes that clot the blood",
  "The blood clotting process  The blood clotting process is a very complex sequence of events in which there are many different clotting factors",
  "Vitamin K is important in the production of many of the compounds needed for the blood to clot, including prothrombin",
  "The events in the blood clotting process is as follow;  Blood clotting process  First, thromboplastin catalyses the conversion of a large soluble protein called prothrombin found in the plasma into another soluble protein, the enzyme called thrombin",
  "Prothrombin, a precursor of a thrombin, is biologically inactive while thrombin is biologically active",
  "This conversion happens on a large scale at the site of a wound",
  "Calcium ions need to be present in the blood at the right concentration for this reaction to happen",
  "Second, thrombin acts on another soluble plasma protein called fibrinogen, converting it to an insoluble substance called fibrin",
  "Again, fibrinogen is the biologically inactive precursor of biologically active fibrin",
  "Finally, the fibrin forms a mesh of fibres to cover the wound and trap the red blood cells, forming blood clot ",
  "The blood is moved through the heart by a series of continuous contraction and relaxation of the muscles in the walls of the four chambers",
  "These events form the cardiac cycle",
  "The contractions of the heart are called systole",
  "Systole can be divided into atrial systole, the contraction of atria and the ventricular systole, the contraction of ventricles",
  "Ventricular systole happens about 0.13 seconds after atrial systole",
  "Between contractions the heart relaxes and fills with blood",
  "This relaxation stage is called diastole",
  "One cycle of systole and diastole makes up a single heartbeat, which lasts about 0.8 seconds in humans",
  "Cardiac muscle cells are myogenic, which means they contract without any external stimulus",
  "They also have intrinsic rhythmicity",
  "An adult heart removed from the body will continue to contract as long as it is bathed in a suitable oxygen-rich fluid",
  "The intrinsic rhythm of the heart is around  beats per minute which is slower than the heartbeat most of the time when awake",
  "There may have many different ways of controlling the heart to make sure it delivers the exact amount of blood when it is needed",
  "Myogenic Control of the Heart Beat   The intrinsic rhythm of the heart is maintained by a wave of electrical excitation similar to a nerve impulse which spreads through special tissue in the heart muscle",
  "The area of the heart with the fastest intrinsic rhythm is a group of cells in the right atrium known as the sinoatrial node, and this acts as the heart's own natural pacemaker which keeps the heart beating regularly",
  "The sinoatrial node (SAN) establishes a wave of electrical excitation (depolarization) which causes the atria to start contracting",
  "This initiates the heartbeat",
  "Excitation also spreads to another area of similar tissue called the atrioventricular node (AVN)",
  "The AVN is excited as a result of the SAN but it produces a slight delay before the wave of depolarization passes into the bundle of His, a group of conducting fibres in the septum of the heart",
  "This makes sure the atria have stopped contracting before the ventricles start",
  "The bundle of His splits into two branches and carries the wave of excitation to the Purkyne tissue",
  "The Purkyne tissue consists of conducting fibres that penetrate down through the septum, spreading around the ventricles",
  "As the depolarization travels through the tissue, it starts the contraction of the ventricles, starting at the bottom and so squeezing blood out of the heart",
  "The speed at which the excitation spreads through the heart, with the hesitation before the AVN stimulates the bundle of His, to ensure that the atria have stopped contracting before the ventricles start",
  "It is these changes in the electrical excitation of the heart that cause the repeating cardiac cycle",
  "These electrical changes can be measured in an electrocardiogram (ECG)",
  "Because the heart has its own basic rhythm, no one has to think about it",
  "Many people have a faster resting heart rate than this basic rhythm; the average is around  beats per minute.This is because lots of other factors, including nerve impulses and hormones, constantly affect the heart rate ",
  "Between the capillaries and the cells is a watery liquid called tissue fluid",
  "Most of the water from tissue fluid reenters capillaries by osmosis",
  "Some fluid passes into another system called the lymphatic system",
  "The lymphatic system consists of vessels similar to blood capillaries, which are sometimes called lymphatic capillaries",
  "They transport the fluid, called lymph, back to the blood by opening into the subclavian veins",
  "The lacteals that carry fats from villi of the small intestine are part of the lymphatic system",
  "Before lymph passes back into the blood, it is filtered to remove dead cells and bacteria",
  "This takes place in swellings called lymph nodes, which contains white blood cells that are important in destroying harmful bacteria",
  "When a person gets infection, one of the first sign may be swelling of the lymph nodes, often referred to as swollen glands "
