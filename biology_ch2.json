  "The study of chemical, physical structures, and functions of biological macromolecules is known as molecular biology",
  "Nucleic acids are the main information-carrying molecules of the cell which direct the process of protein synthesis by determining the inherited characteristics of every living thing",
  "The two main classes of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA)",
  "DNA is the master blueprint for life and constitutes the genetic material in all free-living organisms and most viruses",
  "RNA is the genetic material of certain viruses, but it is also found in all living cells, where it plays an important role in certain processes such as the making of proteins",
  "The Structure of DNA  DNA is a double helix structure consisting of two polynucleotide strands twine around each other",
  "Each polynucleotide strand is made up of many nucleotide molecules",
  "Each nucleotide in DNA is composed of a five-carbon deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen- containing base, all linked together by covalent bonds",
  "Four different nitrogenous bases in DNA that can be categorized into two different forms: purines and pyrimidines",
  "The purine bases are adenine (A) and guanine (G)",
  "They have two fused rings in their chemical structures",
  "The pyrimidine bases are cytosine (C) and thymine (T)",
  "They have a single ring in their chemical structure",
  "Each strand forms a backbone of alternating phosphate groups and sugars",
  "The bases of each nucleotide are attached to each sugar and protrude inward at regular intervals along each strand",
  "There is a constant total distance between the sugar-phosphate backbones",
  "The two strands of a DNA molecule are not identical but are, instead, complementary to each other",
  "This means that a purine molecule is always paired with a pyrimidine molecule",
  "Specifically, adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T) and guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C)",
  "This pairing is called complementary base pairing",
  "As the same bases always complement each other, the base sequence of one strand can be determined from the base sequence of the other strand",
  "Hydrogen bonds link each complementary base pair",
  "So, the sugar molecules are oriented differently",
  "Therefore, each strand has directionality, or a specific orientation",
  "One strand lies in 5' to 3' direction and another strand in 3' to 5' direction",
  "The 5' and 3' come from the numbering of the carbons on the deoxyribose sugar",
  "The phosphate group is on the 5' carbon, and the OH group is on the 3' carbon",
  "Therefore, the end with phosphate group is always referred as 5' end and the opposite end of it will be 3' end",
  "By convention, the sequence of a DNA strand is always written in the 5' to 3' direction",
  "Like DNA, RNA is a polymer of nucleotides",
  "RNA contains four nucleotides with the bases adenine (A), uracil (U), cytosine (C), and guanine (G)",
  "Unlike DNA, RNA is single-stranded",
  "However, tRNA can fold back on itself, and complementary base pairing within the same molecule stabilizes the looped structure",
  "There are several types of RNA molecules",
  "Since all are produced from a DNA template, all are synthesized in the nucleus",
  "Messenger RNA (mRNA) Acts as a template for translation Transfer RNA (tRNA) Carries specific amino acid to mRNA at ribosome  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) Reads the codon on mRNA The Role of DNA",
  "DNA is the hereditary material responsible for passing genetic information from cell to cell and generation to generation",
  "In total, there are around 3.2billion base pairs in the DNA of a typical mammalian cell",
  "This vast number means that there are an almost infinite variety of sequences or bases along the length of a DNA molecule",
  "It is this variety that provides the genetic diversity within living organisms",
  "The DNA molecule is adapted to carry out its functions in a number of ways: It is a very stable structure which normally passes from generation to generation without change",
  "Only rarely does it mutate",
  "Its two separate strands are joined only with hydrogen bonds, which allow them to separate during DNA replication and protein synthesis",
  "It is an extremely large molecule and therefore carries a large amount of genetic information",
  "By having the base pairs within the helical structure of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone, the genetic information is to some extent protected from being corrupted by outside chemical and physical forces",
  "Base pairing leads to DNA being able to replicate and to transfer information to mRNA",
  "The function of the remarkable molecule, DNA depends on the sequence of base pairs that it possesses",
  "This sequence is important to everything it does and, indeed, to life itself",
  "Proteins Involved in DNA Replication Proteins involved with the synthesis of the leading and lagging strands in E",
  "DNA replication is the making of an exact copy of the DNA molecule",
  "The replication is made by a semiconservative method, which was predicted by Watson and Crick and proven by Meselson and Stahl",
  "It is regarded as semiconservative because each of the resulting two molecules consists of one old strand and one new strand",
  "Proteins and enzymes assist in replication of DNA",
  "Replication begins at special sites called origins of replication, the replication bubbles form.",
  "Helicase enzymes unwind the double helix and unzip the two parental strands by breaking hydrogen bonds",
  "The separated two parental strands act as templates",
  "Single-stranded binding proteins act as scaffolding, holding the two strands apart",
  "Topoisomerase lessens the tension on the tight helix",
  "At each end of the replication bubble is a replication fork, a Y-shaped region where the new strands of DNA are elongating",
  "DNA polymerase III cannot initiate the synthesis",
  "The preexisting chain actually consists of RNA primer produced by an enzyme called primase",
  "As the two strands of DNA are antiparallel, they are oriented in opposite directions to each other",
  "Therefore, the formation of two new strands must also be antiparallel to their template strands",
  "DNA polymerase can only add complementary nucleotides, C with G and A with T, to the free 3' end of the primer, never to the ' end",
  "Thus, a new DNA strand can elongate only in the 5' to 3' direction",
  "DNA polymerase replicates the two original strands differently",
  "Although it builds both new strands in the 5' to 3' direction, one strand is formed towards the replication fork in continuous and linear fashion",
  "This is called the leading strand",
  "The other strand, the lagging strand, forms in direction away from the replication fork, in a series of segments called Okazaki fragments",
  "Each Okazaki fragment is about - nucleotides long and then they are joined into one continuous strand by the enzyme DNA ligase",
  "DNA polymerase I carry out mismatch repair, a kind of proofreading that corrects errors",
  "Damaged regions of DNA are excised out by DNA nuclease",
  "Each time the DNA replicates, some nucleotides from the chromosome are lost",
  "To protect against the possible loss of genes at the end of the chromosomes, eukaryotes have special nonsense nucleotide sequences (TAAGGG) at the ends of chromosomes that repeat thousands of times",
  "These protective ends are called telomeres, which are created and controlled by the enzyme telomerase",
  "So, every time DNA replicate, the telomeres get shorter",
  "Genetic code is a set of rules for determining how genetic information in the form of a nucleotide sequence is converted to an amino acid sequence of a protein",
  "It defines a code specifying the relationship between a nucleotide codon and an amino acid",
  "Researchers knew that there are only four nucleotides in RNA (A, U, G, and C), but  different kinds of amino acids",
  "Therefore, there could not be a one-to-one relationship between nucleotides and amino acids",
  "Even using two nucleotides per amino acid would only provide  x, or  possible combinations, which is not enough to code for  amino acids",
  "Thus, the minimum combination of the four nucleotides was a triplet code, which could produce  x  x , or  possible combinations",
  "From this reasoning came the triplet hypothesis, which proposed that the genetic code consists of a combination of three nucleotides, called a codon",
  "Between  and , various research groups compared artificially synthesized RNA molecules of known nucleotide sequences with the amino acid sequences of polypeptides",
  "From these studies, the mRNA codons and their corresponding amino acids were determined",
  "By convention, the genetic code is always interpreted in terms of the mRNA codon rather than the nucleotide sequence of the DNA",
  "The genetic code has three important characteristics",
  "The genetic code is redundant",
  "This means that more than one codon can code for the same amino acid",
  "There are only three codons that do not code for any amino acid",
  "These codons serve as \"stop\" signals to end protein synthesis",
  "The genetic code is continuous",
  "This means that it reads as a series of three-letter codons without spaces, punctuation, or overlap",
  "Therefore, knowing exactly where to start and stop protein synthesis is essential",
  "A shift of one or two nucleotides in either direction can alter the codon groupings and result in an incorrect amino acid sequence",
  "The genetic code is nearly universal",
  "Almost all organisms build proteins with the genetic code shown in Table",
  "(Some rare exceptions are known in some species of protists, for example.)",
  "The universality of the genetic code means that a codon in the fruit fly codes for the same amino acid as in a human",
  "This has important implications for gene technology, such as cloning",
  "A gene that is taken from one kind of organism and inserted into another kind of organism will produce the same protein",
  "The two steps in protein synthesis are transcription and translation",
  "In transcription, mRNA is synthesized based on the DNA template of a gene",
  "This is followed by translation, which involves the production of a protein with an amino acid sequence that is based on the nucleic acid sequence of the mRNA",
  "The central dogma of molecular biology stated that genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to Protein",
  "The translation of nucleotide sequence to amino acid sequence uses the genetic code",
  "Transcription  Transcription occurs in the nucleus of the cell ",
  "It is the process of copying sequence of DNA to mRNA",
  "There are three defined stages in the transcription process; initiation, elongation, and termination",
  "Initiation: -For each gene, only one strand of the double-stranded DNA molecule is transcribed",
  "This strand is called the antisense strand or template strand",
  "The other strand, which is not transcribed, is called the sense strand or coding strand",
  "It has the same sequence as the product mRNA, with thymine instead of uracil",
  "During the elongation phase shown, the RNA polymerase complex works its way along the DNA molecule, synthesizing a strand of mRNA that is complementary to the template strand of DNA in 5' to 3' direction",
  "When the RNA polymerase complexes reach the termination signal, they detach from the DNA strand",
  "The new mRNA strand is released from the transcription assembly",
  "The newly synthesized mRNA is called precursor mRNA or pre-mRNA",
  "Before moving out from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,to modify pre-mRNA to mature mRNA 5'cap is added at to 5'end",
  "Before moving out from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,to modify pre-mRNA to mature mRNA  3' poly-A tail is added at 3' end ",
  "Before moving out from the nucleus to the cytoplasm,to modify pre-mRNA to mature mRNA introns (non-coding regions) are removed with specific enzyme and the remaining exons (coding regions) are joined",
  "The second stage of protein synthesis involves translation which occurs in the cytoplasm",
  "It is the conversion of a sequence of nucleotides into a sequence of amino acid in the polypeptide chain",
  "There are two subunits in the ribosome",
  "At the small subunit, mature mRNA is attached",
  "There are three binding sites for tRNA on the large subunit of ribosome: A site, P site and E site",
  "Each tRNA carries the specific amino acid at a time at its acceptor stem ",
  "Opposite to the acceptor stem is the anticodon which connects to the specific codon on the mRNA",
  "Initiation -In the initiation phase, all the translation components come together",
  "The small ribosomal sub-unit attaches to the mRNA near the start codon (AUG)",
  "The first tRNA that binds to the codon is the initiator tRNA with its UAC anticodon, which joins with the AUG codon of mRNA",
  "Then, a large ribosomal sub-unit joins to form the active ribosome ",
  "Elongation -The polypeptide becomes longer, adding one amino acid at a time",
  "During elongation, a cycle of four steps is rapidly repeated",
  "First, a tRNA with an attached polypeptide is in the P site, then, peptide bond is formed and tRNA carrying the next amino acid enters the A site",
  "Next, the polypeptide chain is transferred to the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site",
  "This makes the polypeptide chain one amino acid longer than before",
  "Last, the mRNA moves forward by one codon, and the polypeptide-bearing tRNA is now at the ribosome P site",
  "The uncharged tRNA exits",
  "The new codon is at the A site and can receive the next complementary tRNA carrying the next amino acid of the polypeptide",
  "Termination -The termination phase begins when a stop codon on the mRNA is reached",
  "The polypeptide and the components of the translation machinery are separated",
  "A protein, called a release factor, cleaves (cuts) the polypeptide from the last tRNA",
  "The polypeptide is released and will eventually fold into its three-dimensional shape as protein, ready to carry out its cellular activities",
  "Protein synthesis: Transcription and Translation  SOME TECHNIQUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY",
  "There are some exciting technologies emerging from research in molecular genetics, which has provided the ability to manipulate the genes of organisms (microorganisms, plants, and animals)",
  "Scientists can now use genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to produce medications, to profile the DNA sequence of a cancerous tumour, and to treat genetic disorders by introducing the correct form of a disease-related gene into an individual's genome",
  "Another intriguing research focus is the relationship between aging and chromosomes",
  "Genetic engineering is the alteration of the genetic material of an organism in a specific manner",
  "Transgenic bacteria, plants, and animals are commonly referred to as genetically modified organisms (GMOs)",
  "Transgenic describes an organism that is produced from the introduction of foreign DNA into its genome, providing it with a new phenotype",
  "The recombinant DNA techniques and methods of DNA analysis are integral to the production of GMOs",
  "It is a method of transferring a gene from one organism into the genome of another organism of different species",
  "In order to insert the recombinant gene into a target cell, a vector is needed, which may be plasmid of bacteria, harmless virus, liposome or gene gun",
  "Plasmid of bacteria Gene gun  Production of Golden Rice",
  "Rice is a staple food in many parts of the world",
  "Vitamin A deficiency can cause blindness",
  "Even more importantly, lack of vitamin A can cause an immune deficiency syndrome, and this is a significant cause of mortality in some parts of the world, particularly in children",
  "Children of families living in poverty often lack animal products in their diets as they are too expensive",
  "Even if such children have a diet containing a wide range of vegetables rich in carotenoids, it is still difficult for them to avoid vitamin A deficiency",
  "Further research showed that substituting the gene from daffodils plant with one from maize gave even higher quantities of carotene, and the single transformation with these genes is the basis of all current Golden Rice",
  "The genetically modified rice is called Golden Rice, because it contains a lot of the orange pigment beta-carotene which can be converted into vitamin A when it is eaten",
  "Benefits of genetic engineering of crops include: i.increased crop yield, ii.increased heat and drought tolerance, iii.increased resistance to a range of pests and pathogens, iv.increased salt tolerance, reduction in harvesting cost and pesticide use, and v.enhanced nutritional value and food quality due to slower spoilage",
  "Moreover, plants are also being engineered to produce medicinal products",
  "Since the mid-s, products such as human growth hormone, clotting factors, and antibodies have been produced in transgenic plants",
  "For instance, one type of antibody made by corn can deliver radioisotopes to tumour cells",
  "Another made by soybeans can be used to treat genital herpes",
  "The production of transgenic animals is a much more complex process than the production of transgenic plants, and not surprisingly, it is also highly controversial",
  "To produce transgenic animals, a foreign gene is inserted into the genome of an animal oocyte (egg) that is then fertilized",
  "The fertilized egg is implanted in a host female and allowed to develop",
  "The resulting offspring are the transgenic form of the animal",
  "The procedure has been used to produce transgenic fish, pigs, cows, rabbits, and sheep",
  "Transgenic animals can be used to produce pharmaceutical products such as human proteins by using a recombinant plasmid vector",
  "The vector contains the gene for the growth protein as well as the promoter that directs the expression of the genes in mammary cells",
  "The recombinant DNA is then injected into an oocyte",
  "The oocyte is fertilized and implanted into a host female",
  "The transgenic animals are the offspring produced from that implantation",
  "The milk of female transgenic offspring contains human growth protein",
  "Benefits of GM animals are  (i)increased production of a particular product, higher milk yield in cows, greater muscle mass in animals used for meat,  (ii) increased resistance to disease,  (iii) manufacture of human proteins, such as antibodies, blood clotting factors or important proteins for medicinal purposes and  (iv) production of organs for transplantation (xerotransplantation)"
