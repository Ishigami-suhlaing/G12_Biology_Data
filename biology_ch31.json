  "Plants make their own organic molecules, using the process of photosynthesis",
  "Carbon dioxide is the source of carbon and light is the source of energy",
  "The main photosynthetic organs are the leaves, which have evolved a large surface area to volume ratio for efficient capturing of carbon dioxide and light",
  "A large surface area to volume ratio means more area for collection of light and carbon dioxide and less distance for carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf and for oxygen to diffuse out",
  "As a result, most plants do not have compact bodies like animals, but have extensive branching bodies with leaves above the ground",
  "In order to obtain the water and mineral salts they needed for nutrition, plants have extensive root systems below the ground",
  "The plant body therefore spreads out to obtain the carbon dioxide, light energy, water and inorganic mineral ions from its environment to make organic molecules like sugars and amino acids",
  "Transport systems are needed for the following reasons: To move substances from where they are absorbed to where they are needed, for example, water and mineral ions are absorbed by roots and transported through the xylem to other parts of the plant",
  "To move substances from where they are produced to where they are needed for metabolism",
  "For example, sugars are produced in leaves, but glucose is needed by all parts of the plant for respiration and for converting to cellulose for making cell walls in areas of growth",
  "Glucose can be moved through the phloem as part of the sucrose molecule",
  "To move substances to a certain part of the plant for storage, for example, sugars usually change into the form of starch, for storage in a potato tuber",
  "Plants can be very large, but they have a branching shape that helps to keep the surface area to volume ratio large",
  "Their energy needs are generally small compared with those of animals, so respiration does not take place quickly",
  "They can rely on diffusion to supply their cells with oxygen and to remove carbon dioxide",
  "Their leaves are very thin and have a large surface area inside them in contact with the air spaces",
  "This means that diffusion is sufficient to supply the mesophyll cells with carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, and to remove oxygen",
  "Plants have two transport systems: Xylem, which transports water and inorganic ions from the roots to all parts of the plant",
  "Phloem, which transports substances made in the plant, such as sucrose and amino acids, from the leaves to all other parts of the plant",
  "Xylem tissue contains dead, empty hollow cells with no end walls",
  "These are composed of xylem vessels which are arranged in long lines to form a hollow tube",
  "Water moves through these long, hollow tubes by mass flow from the roots to all other parts of the plant",
  "Phloem tissue contains cells called sieve tube",
  "Unlike xylem vessel, these are living cells and contain cytoplasm and a few organelles but no nucleus",
  "Their walls are made of cellulose",
  "A companion cell is associated with each sieve tube",
  "Within a plant, mineral ions and organic compounds (e.g., sucrose) are transported by being dissolved in water",
  "The dissolved mineral ions are transported in the xylem tissue and the dissolved organic compounds are transported in the phloem tissue",
  "The plant roots are responsible for the uptake of water and mineral ions and can have root hairs to increase the surface area for absorption of the substances",
  "The uptake of water is a passive process and occurs by osmosis (the diffusion of water from a higher water potential to a lower water potential)",
  "The uptake of minerals can be passive transport such as diffusion and osmosis, and/or active transport",
  "In the active absorption, the water first enters the cell sap and passes from one cell to another",
  "This type of movement where protoplasm is involved is called symplast",
  "In passive absorption, water moves through the apoplast of the root",
  "The apoplast path includes the cell wall and intercellular spaces",
  "Two pathways are apoplastic and symplastic that initiate the passage of water along with ions from root hair via root cortex to xylem",
  "These routes may exist either simultaneously or separately having different rates",
  "Apoplastic pathway  Most water travels via the apoplastic pathway (when transpiration rates are high), which is the series of spaces running through the cellulose cell walls, dead cells, and the hollow tubes of the xylem",
  "The water moves by diffusion (as it does not pass through a partially permeable membrane)",
  "The water can move from cell wall to cell wall directly or through the intercellular spaces",
  "The movement of water through the apoplastic pathway occurs more rapidly than the symplastic pathway",
  "When the water reaches the endodermis the presence of a thick, waterproof, waxy band of suberin within the cell wall blocks the apoplastic pathway",
  "This band is called the Casparian strip and forms an impassable barrier for the water",
  "A smaller amount of water travels via the symplastic pathway, which is the cytoplasm and plasmodesmata or vacuole of the cells",
  "The water moves by osmosis into the cell (across the partially permeable cell surface membrane), possibly into the vacuole (through the tonoplast by osmosis) and between cells through the plasmodesmata",
  "The movement of water in the symplastic pathway is slower than the apoplastic pathway",
  "The cells in the mesophyll layers are not tightly packed and have many spaces around them filled with air",
  "The walls of the mesophyll cells are wet and some of this water evaporates into the air space, so that the air inside the leaf is usually saturated with water vapour",
  "The air in the internal spaces of the leaf has directly contacted with the air outside the leaf, through small pores called stomata",
  "If there is a water potential gradient between the air inside the leaf (higher water potential) and the air outside of the leaf (lower water potential), then water vapour will diffuse out of the leaf down this gradient",
  "Although some of the water in the leaf will be used, for example, in photosynthesis, most eventually evaporates and diffuses out of the leaf by the process of transpiration",
  "The environmental factors affecting the rate of transpiration are: Humidity: If the water potential gradient between the air spaces in the leaf and the air outside becomes steeper, the rate of transpiration will increase",
  "In condition of low humidity, the gradient is steep, so transpiration takes place more quickly than in high humidity",
  "Wind speed and temperature: Transpiration rate may also be increased by an increasing in wind speed or rising in temperature",
  "Light intensity: In most plants, stomata open during the day and close at night",
  "Most transpiration takes place through the stomata, so the rate of transpiration is almost zero at night",
  "Stomata must be opened during the day to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the leaf for photosynthesis",
  "This inevitably increases the rate of transpiration",
  "Closing at night, when photosynthesis is impossible, reduces unnecessary water loss",
  "Very dry conditions: In especially dry conditions, when the water potential gradient between the internal air spaces and the external air is steep, a plant may have to compromise by partially or completely closing its stomata to prevent its leaves drying out, even if this mean reducing the rate of photosynthesis",
  "In hot conditions, transpiration plays an important role in cooling the leaves",
  "As water evaporates from the cell walls inside the leaf, it absorbs heat energy from these cells, thus reducing their temperature",
  "If the rate at which water vapour is lost by transpiration exceeds the rate at which a plant can take up water from the soil, then the amount of water in its cells decreases",
  "The cells become less turgid and the plant wilts as the soft parts such as leaves loose the support provided turgid cells",
  "In this situation, the plant will also close its stomata",
  "Transpiration is regarded as a beneficial fact to the plants for many reasons: Ascent of sap: Ascent of sap mostly occurs due to transpiration pull exerted by transpiration of water",
  "This pull also helps in absorption of water",
  "Removal of excess water: It has been held that plants absorb far more amount of water than is actually required by them",
  "Transpiration, therefore, removes the excess of water",
  "Cooling effect: Radiant heat falling on the plants increases their temperature that may be dangerous to the plants",
  "Transpiration, by evaporating water, bring down (or lowers) their temperature by °-°C",
  "Mechanical tissue: The development of mechanical tissue, which is essential for providing rigidity and strength to the plant, is favoured by the increase in transpiration",
  "Distribution of mineral salts: Mineral salts are mostly distributed by rising column of sap",
  "Increasing concentration of mineral salts: The sap absorbed from the soil contains low concentration of mineral salts",
  "The loss of water through transpiration increases the concentration of mineral salts in the plant",
  "Root system: Transpiration helps in better development of root system, which is required for support, and absorption of mineral salts",
  "Quality of fruits: The ash and sugar content of the fruit increases with the increase in transpiration",
  "Resistance: Excessive transpiration induces hardening and resistant to moderate drought",
  "Turgidity: Transpiration helps the shape and structure of plant parts by keeping cells turgid",
  "Photosynthesis: Transpiration supplies water for photosynthesis",
  "As water evaporates through the stomata, it results in pulling of water, molecule by molecule into the leaf from the xylem",
  "Thistle funnel is filled with water and rubber stopper attaches a leafy twig to it",
  "The bottom of the funnel is immersed in a bowl of mercury",
  "After some time, the level of mercury in the thistle funnel rises",
  "Loss of water from the twig (ie., transpiration) produces a vacuum in the thistle funnel and water will be drawn up",
  "This in turn produces a vacuum at the bottom of the funnel, which is then filled by the rising mercury",
  "This rise of water and mercury is due to transpiration pull",
  "Translocation is the movement of dissolved substances through a plant",
  "In general, water and dissolved salts from the soil travel upwards through the vessels of the xylem and food synthesized in the leaves passes downwards or upwards in the sieve tubes of the phloem",
  "When leaves photosynthesize, they produce carbohydrates",
  "Once in the stem it may travel upwards to actively growing regions or maturing fruits and seeds or downwards to the roots and underground storage organs",
  "Both upward and downward movement may take place at the same time in the phloem",
  "The phloem tissue is a complex tissue",
  "The consisting components are sieve tube, companion cell, phloem parenchyma and phloem fibre",
  "They are living cells except phloem fibre",
  "In the translocation process, sieve tubes or sieve cells which have no nucleus and companion cells possess do work together",
  "They are cylindrical cells with layers of cytoplasm like materials just inside their cell walls",
  "They are so called because of the presence of perforations in the cell septate walls known as sieve plates",
  "These are main components through which translocation take place and permit the plant materials to pass from one cell to another",
  "Sieve cells can manage translocation without nuclei because they are kept alive by the nucleated companion cells that always situated adjacent to sieve cells",
  "There are profuse cytoplasmic connections between sieve and companion cells",
  "Moreover, phloem tissue is strengthened by fibre cells besides the sieve and companion cells"
