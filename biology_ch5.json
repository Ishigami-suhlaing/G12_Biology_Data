  "Stimulus is a detectable change in the internal or external environment which influence a temporary increase of physiological activity or response in the whole plant or any part of plant",
  "In the plant, there are two types such as internal stimuli and external stimuli",
  "The responses to external stimuli or environmental changes that are produced by the working of various organs in a systematic and controlled manner are known as coordination",
  "The movement of plant parts is due to various external and internal stimuli",
  "External stimuli are water, gravity, light intensity and duration, chemicals, temperature and touch",
  "Internal stimuli or internal control are chemicals called plant hormones",
  "Plants lack a nervous system like animals",
  "But they can sense things around them and respond to them",
  "Thus, coordination and response in plants are undertaken by plant hormones or plant growth regulators or phytohormones",
  "Plants can respond to their environment in various ways",
  "These plant responses have evolved because they provide the plant with some type of selective advantage (e.g., making them better adapted to survive and reproduce in their environment)",
  "The environmental stimuli to which plants respond to abiotic or biotic stress",
  "Examples of plant responses include the tropisms, responses to touch, responses to herbivory and responses to abiotic stress",
  "Plant responses to herbivory Plant responses to abiotic stress ",
  "There are various types of tissues present in plants, which occupy specific locations throughout their body",
  "These tissues have different structural and functional aspects like growth and development",
  "Growth in general is considered as an increase in size of the object",
  "The process of development occurs in an ordered fashion within a single diploid cell called zygote",
  "It grows through various types of mitotic divisions",
  "The cells produced after such divisions differentiate to give required tissue",
  "Growth  Growth can be defined as an irreversible increase in size of an individual cell or organ or its parts",
  "This increase occurs as a result of all the metabolic activities",
  "These activities make use of energy obtained by nutrition",
  "Phases of growth  In plants, growth occurs in three phases depending upon the region of its occurrence",
  "Meristematic phase (Formative phase): It occurs in the meristematic regions, e.g., shoot apex and root apex",
  "The cells in this phase can be easily differentiated from other cells",
  "The cells of meristems are isodiametric, thin walled, and consist of large nucleus and dense cytoplasm",
  "Elongation phase (Phase of cells enlargement); cells of this phase are found around the meristematic cells",
  "These cells are highly vacuolated",
  "Maturation phase (Phase of cell maturation and differentiation): Cells of this phase undergo structural and functional differentiation and thus, these cells develop into a specialized tissue",

  "Some special chemical substances regulate growth and development in plants",
  "These substances are also called plant hormones or phytohormones",
  "A plant hormone is an organic compound",
  "It is synthesized in one part of a plant in minute quantities and from there it is translocated to another part where it causes a physiological response",
  "Characteristics of plant growth regulators  Phytohormones are essential organic compounds required in very small quantities",
  "These are generally synthesized at the apices of root, stem and in leaves",
  "A single hormone may regulate different aspects of growth",
  "Their synthesis is under genetic control and influenced by environmental factors",
  "Type of plant growth regulators  They can be placed under two groups based on their function",
  "c.g., ethylene and abscisic acid can induce dormancy and abscission",
  " Auxin  Auxins are weak organic acids produced naturally by plants",
  "It is the first plant growth regulator",
  "Chemically this hormone is indole acetic acid (IAA)",
  "Actively growing regions of a plant usually produce the largest amounts of auxins",
  "The regions rich in auxins are the meristems, including shoot tips, root tips, cambia and also young leaves, developing flowers and fruits",
  "Physiological effects of auxin            Some physiological effects of auxin in plants are as follows: i.Root inhibition: Auxin inhibits the elongation of primary roots",
  "However, it can stimulate the initiation of lateral and adventitious roots",
  "ii.Parthenocarpy: Application of auxin to unpollinated pistil makes them develop seedless fruits or parthenocarpy",
  "iii.Cell elongation: It stimulates the elongation of cells in the shoot and promotes cell enlargement",
  "iv.Abscission: In younger parts, auxin delays abscission",
  "On the other hand, in mature parts, it stimulates abscission",

  "ii.Stem and leaf growth: Gibberellins can stimulate stem elongation",
  "iii.Seed germination: Gibberellins promote seed germination",
  "They stimulate the synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes like amylases, proteases, etc",
  " Cytokinin  Cytokinin is a basic hormone and purine (adenine) derivative",
  "It primarily acts on cell division, but it also has important interactions with auxin in the growth and development of plants",
  "Cytokinin occurs naturally in the regions with high cell division, e.g., root apices",

  "Maximum synthesis of ethylene occurs during the ripening of fruits",
  "Physiological effects of ethylene            Some physiological effects of ethylene in plants are as follows: i.Ethylene stimulates ripening of fruits",
  "It also increases the rate of respiration",
  "Due to this, ethylene is used in post-harvest technology i.e., for commercial ripening of fruits",
  "ii.Ethylene causes drooping of leaves and flowers",
  "iii.Ethylene induces rapid growth of internodes and leaf bases",
  " Abscisic acid  Abscisic acid, also known as abscisin or dormin, is an example in the group of hormones that promote dormancy in plants",
  "It is also known as stress hormone",
  "It is produced naturally, when a plant is exposed to stress",
  "The common stresses include lack of water, saline soils, cold temperature and frost",

  "Leaf color changes during abscission",
  "Seed Dormancy ",
  "Seed Dormancy  The internal inhibition of germination of a normal or viable seed even, when it is placed under most favourable conditions required for its germination is called seed dormancy",
  "Causes of seed dormancy are hard seed coats impermeable to water and gases, presence of immature embryo, light sensitive seeds and presence of germination inhibitors",
  "Dormant seeds remain under non-germinating condition only for a specific period of time that may vary from days to years",
  "This specific period is called their dormancy period",
  "The dormancy of seeds can be broken by scarification, stratification, hormonal treatment, etc",
  "Scarification  Stratification  Hormonal treatment ",
  "Seed Germination ",
  "Seed Germination  Seed germinates in favourable conditions",
  "It absorbs water through micropyle and softens the seed coat",
  "The food present in seed is mobilized by the activation of enzymes like amylase, lipase, protease which are transported to the embryo",
  "The radicle grows first, followed by the growth of either epicotyl or hypocotyl",
  "After that, the plumule grows",
  "Seed germination can be of following types",
  "Epigeal germination takes place above the ground",
  "The cotyledons are first pushed above the ground by the rapid elongation of hypocotyl",
  "e.g., bean seed, castor seed etc",
  "Hypogeal germination in which the epicotyl elongates faster than hypocotyl at the time of seed germination",
  "It keeps cotyledons inside the soil or may bring them just above the soil surface",
  "e.g., mango, coconut etc",
  "Vivipary germination of seeds inside the fruit, which is still attached to the parent tree is called vivipary",
  "e.g., Agave and mangroves ",
  "Photoperiodism Effect or requirements of relative length of day and night on flowering is called photoperiodism",
  "Most plants flower only when they are subjected to a light phase for less or more than a critical period",
  "A critical period is the period of light or darkness required by the plant to induce flowering",
  "Photoperiodism Plants require a certain day length to flower",
  "This relative length of day and night needed for flowering is called as photoperiod",
  "The length of the day and night above and below which a plant would not flower is called critical photoperiod",
  "Depending upon the duration of photoperiod, plants have been divided into following categories",
  " Short day plants: They require shorter photoperiod than their critical photoperiod in order to initiate flowering",
  "They are long night plants",
  "e.g., soybean, onion etc",
  "Long day plants: They require longer day light period than their critical photoperiod for flowering",
  "They are short night plants",
  "e.g., radish, potato etc",
  "Day neutral plants: They are indeterminate plants",
  "The floral initiation in them is independent of photoperiodism",
  "e.g., tomato, cotton, etc",
  "Physiology of flowering  It is proposed that a hormone called florigen is synthesized in leaves which is responsible for initiation of flowering",
  "Photomorphogenesis ",
  "Photomorphogenesis  Plants can sense light direction, quality, intensity and periodicity",
  "Light induces phototropism, photomorphogenesis, flowering, germination, etc",
  "Plants exhibit different growth habits in dark and light",
  "In the dark, they have elongated stems, undifferentiated chloroplasts and unexpanded leaves",
  "This is called photomorphogenesis",
  "Photomorphogenesis involves inhibition of stem elongation, differentiation of chloroplast, accumulation of chlorophyll, and expansion of leaves",
  "Photomorphogenesis can be induced by red, far-red and blue light",
  "Light is perceived in plants by photoreceptor i.e., phytochrome, cryptochrome and phototropin",
  "The photomorphogenesis stimulus is perceived in leaves by phytochrome",
  "Phytochrome is a protein containing covalently attached chromophore",
  "It is a blue- green pigment",
  "Importance of photomorphogenesis  Plant growth and development are influenced by a variety of environmental factors, including light",
  "Light, on the other hand, causes a variety of responses in the plant body in addition to photosynthesis",
  "These responses have a significant impact on the course of plant growth and the final plant appearance",
  "They are morphogenic responses to light",
  "Many plant seeds, for example, do not germinate unless they are exposed to light",
  "Seed germination in light demonstrates that seedlings require light to grow",
  "Phototropic responses of seedlings and mature plant leaves are also photomorphogenic processes",
  "Older plants rely on photomorphogenesis responses as well",
  "Many of these responses are in response to the relative lengths of day and night by forming reproductive structures or dormant buds that can withstand a cold winter (i.e., the phenomenon of photoperiodism and vernalization)",
  "COORDINATION AND RESPONSE IN ANIMALS ",
  "COORDINATION AND RESPONSE IN ANIMALS  Coordination is the process involved in the detection of stimuli by receptors, and also the integration of the information received and the subsequent actions of the effectors to produce responses to the stimuli",
  "The coordination process starts with the stimulus and ends with the response",
  "Coordination involves two main body systems: the nervous system, which is involved in the transmission of nerve impulses and the endocrine system, which is involved in the secretion of hormones",
  "Living organisms respond to changes in the internal environment and the external environment",
  "A change in the environment which can be detected by the body is called stimulus (plural: stimuli)",
  "The main purpose for living organisms respond to certain stimuli is to ensure the continuity of life or survival of the organisms",
  "It is necessary for animals respond to stimuli are  (a) to adapt to the environment,  (b) for protection from danger,  (c) for safety (to move to a safer place) and  (d) to regulate the internal environment by homeostasis",

  "central and peripheral nervous system   The central nervous system  The central nervous system is composed of the brain and the spinal cord which are located at the central axis of the body",
  "The brain  The brain can be subdivided into three general regions: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain",
  "The forebrain comprises the cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus, and the hindbrain consists of the cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata",
  "Despite its central importance, the brain is fragile and has a gelatin-like consistency",
  "The skull forms a protective bony armour around the brain",
  "In addition, the meninges, three layers of tough, elastic tissue within the skull and spinal column, directly enclose the brain and spinal cord ., ",

  "The parts of brain and their structures, locations and functions Parts of brain Structure and location Function thalamus  -at the base of the forebrain",
  "It consists of neurones that provide connections between various parts of the brain",
  "These connections are mainly between the forebrain and hindbrain, and between areas of the sensory system (except for the sense of smell) and cerebellum",
  "-acts as \"the great relay station\" of the brain  Parts of brain Structure and location Function hypothalamus   -lies just below the thalamus -helps to regulate the body's internal environment, as well as certain aspects of behaviour -contains neurones that control blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and basic drives (such as thirst and hunger) and emotions (such as fear, rage, and pleasure) -brain damage or a tumour that affects the hypothalamus can cause a person to display unusual, even violent behaviour also acts as a major link between the nervous and endocrine (hormone) systems  Parts of brain Structure and location Function midbrain   -above the pons in the brainstem  -involved in processing information from sensory neurones in the eyes, ears, and nose  -relays visual and auditory information between areas of the hindbrain and forebrain -it plays an important role in eye movement and control of skeletal muscles Parts of brain Structure and location Function cerebellum   -walnut-shaped structure located below and largely behind the cerebrum -involved in the unconscious coordination of posture, reflexes, and body movements, as well as fine, voluntary motor skills -receives information from specialized sensors, called proprioceptors, located within skeletal muscles and joints Parts of brain Structure and location Function pons   -above and in front of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem -serves as a relay centre between the neurones of the right and left halves of the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the rest of the brain Parts of brain Structure and location Function medulla oblongata   -at the base of the brainstem, where - coordinates many reflexes and automatic bodily -it connects the brain with the spinal functions that maintain homeostasis, including cord heart rate, constriction or dilation of blood vessels, and the rate and depth of breathing, swallowing, and coughing",
  "Spinal cord  A cross section of the spinal cord, reveals both white matter and grey matter",
  "The outer white matter consists of myelinated nerve fibres",
  "The butterfly-shaped core is made up of grey matter, which contains unmyelinated neurones as well as the cell bodies and dendrites of many spinal neurones ",
  "The delicate tissues of the spinal cord are protected by cerebrospinal fluid, soft tissue layers, and the spinal column",
  "The spinal column consists of a series of backbones (vertebrae) ",
  "Injury to the spinal column can also damage the spinal cord, resulting in paralysis",
  "Peripheral nervous system  The peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that link the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body, including the senses, muscles, glands, and internal organs",
  "The somatic nervous system  The somatic nervous system is under the voluntary control, and its neurones service to the head, trunk, and limbs",
  "Its sensory neurones carry information from the receptors in the skin, tendons, and skeletal muscles",
  "Its motor neurones carry information to the skeletal muscles",
  "The somatic system includes  pairs of cranial nerves and  pairs of spinal nerves, all of which are myelinated",
  "The cranial nerves are largely associated with functions in the head, neck, and face",
  "An exception is the vagus nerve, which has branches to the throat and larynx, but also connects to many internal organs, including the heart, lungs, bronchi, digestive tract, liver, and pancreas",
  "The basic divisions of the spinal nerves that emerge from each side of the spinal cord are shown in Figure ",
  "Each spinal nerve contains both sensory and motor neurones, which service the area of the body where they are found",
  "For example, thoracic nerves control the muscles of the rib cage",
  "The autonomic nervous system  Internal reactions to the situation would be controlled by the autonomic nervous system",
  "In contrast to the somatic system, the autonomic system is under automatic, or involuntary control",
  "Its nerves either stimulate or inhibit the glands or the cardiac or smooth muscle",
  "The autonomic system maintains homeostasis by adjusting the body to variations in the external and internal environments without an individual having to think about it and control it consciously",
  "The reflex arc  Some neurones are organized to enable the body to react rapidly in times of danger, even before consciously aware of the threat",
  "These sudden, involuntary responses to certain stimuli are called reflexes ",
  "Examples of reflexes are   jerking the hand away from a hot or sharp object,   blinking when an object moves toward the eye, or   vomiting in response to food that irritates the stomach",
  "Reflex arcs are simple connections of only three neurones to transmit messages",
  "As a result, reflexes can be very rapid, occurring in about  ms (milliseconds)",
  "For example, Figure ",
  "illustrated a typical neural circuit of withdrawal reflex from a potentially painful situation",
  "The reflex arc Receptors in the skin sense the pressure of the cactus needle and initiate an impulse in a sensory neurone",
  "The impulse carried by the sensory neurone then activates the interneurone in the spinal cord which then signals the motor neurone to instruct the muscle to contract and withdraw the hand",
  "A reflex arc moves directly to and from the brain or spinal cord, before the brain centres involved with voluntary control have time to process the sensory information",
  "Sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems  The sympathetic nervous system is typically activated in stressful situations, a response often referred to as the fight-or-flight response",
  "The sympathetic neurones release a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, which has an excitatory effect on its target muscles",
  "The parasympathetic nervous system is activated when the body is calm and at rest",
  "It acts to restore and conserve energy",
  "Sometimes referred to as the rest-and-digest response",
  "The parasympathetic system uses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to control organ responses (Table .)",

  "Structure of Neurones ",
  "Structure of Neurones  The nervous system is composed of only two main types of cells: neurones or nerve cells and cells that support the neurones, which are called glial cells",
  "Neurones are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system",
  "They are specialized to respond to physical and chemical stimuli, to conduct electrochemical signals, and to release chemicals that regulate various body processes",
  "Individual neurones are organized into tissues called nerves",
  "The activity of neurones is supported by another type of cells called glial cells",
  "The word glial comes from a Greek word that means \"glue.\"  Collectively, glial cells nourish the neurones, remove their wastes, and defend against infection",
  "Glial cells also provide a supporting framework for all the nervous- system tissue ",
  "Neurones have many of the same features as other body cells, such as a cell membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and a nucleus",
  "In addition, neurones have specialized cell structures: dendrites and axons, that enable them to transmit nerve impulses",
  "Dendrites are short, branching terminals of dendron that receive nerve impulses from other neurones or sensory receptors, and relay the impulse to the cell body",
  "The dendrites are numerous and highly branched, which increases the surface area available to receive information",
  "The axon conducts impulses away from the cell body",
  "Axons range in length from  mm to  m, depending on the neurone's location in the body",
  "The terminal end of an axon branches into many fibres to communicate with adjacent neurones, glands, or muscles",
  "The axon terminal releases chemical signals into the space between it and the receptors or dendrites of neighbouring cells ",
  "The axons of some neurones are enclosed in a fatty, insulating layer called the myelin sheath, which is made up of Schwann cells, a type of glial cell, by wrapping themselves around the axon",
  "Functions of the myelin sheath are; to protect the nerve fibre or axon from injury, to supply nutrients to axon, to act as an insulator to the nerve impulses, to increase the speed of transmission of the nerve impulses",
  "Neurones can be classified based on their structure as well as their function",
  "Structurally, neurones are classified based on the number of processes that extend from the cell body",
  "Functionally, neurones are classified as one of three main types: sensory neurones, interneurones and motor neurones",
  "Sensory neurones transmit impulses from the sensory receptors to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)",
  "Interneurones are found entirely within the central nervous system",
  "They act as a link between the sensory and motor neurones",
  "Motor neurones transmit information from the central nervous system to effectors (muscles and glands) (Table ",

  "Synapses  The connection between two neurones, or a neurone and an effector, is called a synapse",
  "A neuromuscular junction is a synapse between a motor neurone and a muscle cell",
  "An impulse travels the length of the axon until it reaches the far end, called the synaptic terminal",
  "Neurones are not directly connected but have a small gap between them called the synaptic cleft",
  "Although the synaptic cleft is only about ",
  "μ wide, neurones are not close enough for the impulse to jump from one to the other",
  "Chemical messengers called neurotransmitters carry the neural signal from one neurone to another",
  "Neurotransmitters can also carry the neural signal from a neurone to an effector, such as a gland or muscle fibre",
  "shows the sequence of events in the movement of an impulse across a synapse",
  "When an action potential arrives at the end of a presynaptic neurone, the impulse causes intracellular sacs that contain neurotransmitters to fuse with the membrane of the axon",
  "These sacs, called synaptic vesicles, release their contents into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis",
  "The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the synapse, taking about ",
  "to  ms to reach the dendrites of the postsynaptic neurone, or cell membrane of the effector",
  "Upon reaching the postsynaptic membrane, the neurotransmitters bind to specific receptor proteins in this membrane",
  "The receptor proteins trigger ion-specific channels to open",
  "This depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane and, if the threshold potential is reached, initiates an action potential",
  "The impulse will travel along the postsynaptic neurone to its terminal and to the next neurone or an effector",
  "Neurotransmitters  Neurotransmitters have either excitatory or inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane",
  "If the effect is excitatory, the receptor proteins will trigger ion channels that open to allow positive ions, such as sodium, to flow into the postsynaptic neurone",
  "As a result, the membrane becomes slightly depolarized",
  "If the neurotransmitter is inhibitory, the receptor will trigger potassium channels to open, allowing potassium ions to flow out",
  "This results in a more negative membrane potential, resulting in hyperpolarization",
  "One example of an excitatory neurotransmitter is acetylcholine",
  "Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that crosses a neuromuscular junction",
  "Acetylcholine excites the muscle cell membrane, causing depolarization and contraction of the muscle fibre",
  "There are more than  substances in the human body that can act as neurotransmitters",

  "SENSE ORGANS  To survive, organisms must detect changes in the environment and react appropriately to the changes",
  "To detect changes in the environment, humans and other organisms have highly developed sense organs, such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin- that receive stimuli",
  "Sense organs are organs in which sensory receptors are highly concentrated",
  "When the sensory receptors of a particular sense organ receive appropriate stimulation, they convert the stimulus into electrical signals or action potential",
  "These electrical signals are sent to the specific region of the brain",
  "The brain has a specific region for each sense",
  "Thus, signal received by the vision region of the occipital lobe of brain are interpreted as images",
  "Different parts of human eyes are described in the Table ., Figures ",
  "Parts Description Function Sclera outermost coat of the eyeball tough, fibrous and opaque protects the eye from physical injuries maintains the shape of the eyeball Table ",

  "In addition, each eye forms a slightly different image of an object",
  "The brain combines the information from each eye, giving a person stereoscopic or three-dimensional vision",
  "This allows a person to judge the distance and depth of objects and to estimate the speed of moving objects more accurately ",
  "The role of the iris is to control the amount of light entering the eye, by changing the size of the pupil",
  "The iris contains two types of muscle",
  "Circular muscles form a ring shape in the iris and radial muscles lie like the spokes of the wheel",
  "In bright light, the pupil is constricted",
  "This happens because the circular muscles contract and the radial muscles relax",
  "In dim light, the opposite happens",
  "The radial muscles contract and the circular muscles relax, dilating (widening) the pupil ",
  "Accommodation: Focusing on objects at different distances Accommodation: Focusing on objects at different distances  When the eye is focused on a distant object, the rays of light from the object are almost parallel when they reach the cornea ",
  "The cornea refracts the rays, but the lens does not need to refract them much more to focus the light on the retina",
  "This means the lens does not need to be more convex",
  "The ciliary muscles relax and the pressure in the eye pushes outwards on the lens, flattening it and stretching the suspensory ligaments",
  "This is the condition when an eye is at rest, the eyes are focusing on the long distance",
  "When the eyes focus on a nearby object, for example reading a book, the light rays from the object are spreading out (diverging) as they enter the eye ",
  "In this situation, the lens has to be more convex in order to refract the rays enough to focus them on the retina",

  "Endocrine glands secrete chemical messengers called hormones directly into the bloodstream, which transports the hormones throughout the body",
  "The original Greek meaning of the word hormone is to \"excite\" or \"set in motion.\"  Compared to the rapid actions of the nervous system, the endocrine system typically has slower and longer acting effects and affects a broader range of cell types",
  "Endocrine Glands and Hormones ",
  "Endocrine Glands and Hormones  The endocrine glands found in human body are shown in Figure ",
  "There are two main types of hormones; steroid hormones and water-soluble hormones",
  "Steroid hormones, such as testosterone, estrogen, and cortisol, are lipid-based",
  "Water-soluble hormones are epinephrine, human growth hormone (hGH), thyroxine (T), and insulin",
  "Endocrine glands of human Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Hypothalamus  Hypothalamic releasing and inhibiting hormones Regulates anterior pituitary hormones Table ",
  "Human endocrine glands and some of their hormones Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Anterior pituitary Human growth hormone (hGH) Stimulates cell division, bone and muscle growth, and metabolic function Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Anterior pituitary  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) Stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Stimulates production of ova and sperm from the ovaries and testes Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Anterior pituitary  Luteinizing hormone (LH)  Stimulates sex hormone production from the ovaries and testes Prolactin (PRL)  Stimulates milk production from the mammary glands Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Posterior pituitary  Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) Promotes the retention of water by the kidneys Oxytocin (OCT)  Stimulates uterine muscle contractions and release of milk by the mammary glands Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Thyroid  Thyroxine (T)  Affects all tissues; increases metabolic rate and regulates growth and development Calcitonin  Targets bones and kidneys to lower blood calcium by inhibiting release of calcium from bone and reabsorption of calcium by kidneys Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Parathyroid  Parathyroid hormone (PTH)  Raises blood calcium levels by stimulating the bone cells to release calcium, the intestine to absorb calcium from food, and the kidneys to reabsorb calcium Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Adrenal cortex  Glucocorticoides (for example cortisol) Stimulates tissues to raise blood glucose and break down protein Mineralocorticoides (for example, aldosterone) Promotes reabsorption of sodium and water by the kidneys Gonadocorticoides Promotes secondary sexual characteristics Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Adrenal medulla Epinephrine and nor-epinephrine Fight-or- flight hormones Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Pancreas  Insulin  Lowers blood glucose levels and promotes the formation of glycogen in the liver  Glucagon  Raises blood glucose levels by converting glycogen in the liver to glucose Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Ovaries Estrogen Stimulates uterine lining growth and promotes development of the female secondary sexual characteristics Progesterone Promotes growth of the uterine lining and prevents uterine muscle contractions Endocrine gland Hormone secreted Effects of hormone on target tissue/organs Testes Testosterone  Promotes sperm formation and development of the male secondary sexual characteristics ",

  "Both the nervous system and endocrine system coordinate the body's activities",
  "Both systems need a stimulus to produce a response",
  "Both types of coordination have specific effectors as target organs"
