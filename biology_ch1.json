  "Life on Earth is simply amazing - diverse, resilient, powerful, intelligent, and mystify",
  "In the time, that humans have studied biology understanding of its five major themes has been able to be categorized",
  "New Properties Emerge at Successive Levels of Biological Organization",
  "The hierarchy of life on earth is unfolded as follows: biosphere, ecosystem, community, population, organism, organ system, organ, tissue, cell, organelle, molecule and atom",
  "With each set up, new properties emerge (emergent properties) because of interactions among components at the lower levels",
  "The structure and function of biological components are interrelated",
  "Level of organization  At each level of the biological hierarchy, a correlation of structure and function can be observed",
  "For example, the hummingbird's anatomy allows the wings to rotate at the shoulder, so hummingbirds have the ability, unique among birds, to fly backward or hover in place",
  "While hovering, the birds can extend their long, slender beaks into flowers and feed on nectar ",
  "Structure of hummingbird related to its function The cell, one of the steps composed in the hierarchy of life is a basic unit structure and function of an organism",
  "It is the lowest level of organization that can perform all activities required for life",
  "Cells are either prokaryote or eukaryote",

  "The genetic information is encoded in the nucleotide sequences of DNA",
  "The DNA transmits heritable information from parents to offspring",
  "DNA sequences (called genes) act as instructions to make a cell's protein production by being transcribed into mRNA and then translated into specific proteins",
  "These processes are called gene expression",
  "Gene expression can also produce some RNAs that are not translated into proteins but serve other important functions ",
  "Energy flows through the ecosystem",
  "All organisms require energy for their life",

  "In The animal world, the difference between prey and predator : the horizontal line in eyes means the animal is prey in order to see the place in a comprehensive view ",
  "While the vertical line in eyes means that the animal is a Predator in order to see the target accurately ",
  "Competition  In feedback regulation, a process is regulated by its output or product",
  "In negative feedback, accumulation of the product slows its production",
  "In positive feedback, a product speeds up its own production",
  "Feedback is a type of regulation common to life at all levels, from molecules to ecosystems",
  "The process of a positive feedback loop in human  ",

  "Domain Bacteria and Archaea consist of prokaryotes",
  "Domain Eukarya includes various groups of protists as well as fungi, plants, and animals ",
  "Protists   Darwin (-) proposed natural selection as the mechanism for evolutionary adaptation of populations to their environments",
  "Natural selection is thus defined as the evolutionary process that occurs when a population is exposed to environmental factors that consistently cause individuals with certain heritable traits to have greater reproductive success than do individuals with other heritable traits",
  "Scientific research and the development of new tools and techniques have undoubtedly improved the quality of our lives",
  "Generally, the relevance of biology is the important of the human society and humankind",

  "Out of the three distinct seasons, the monsoon season is the main rice production season as rice paddies rely on copious amounts of water",
  "There are two dominant rice production systems: rain fed lowland and irrigated lowland",
  "Irrigated lowland Rain fed lowland  The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings",
  "This simple method requires sound irrigation planning but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state and deters vermin",
  "While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil",
  "Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a grass widely cultivated for its seeds, a cereal grain that is a worldwide staple food",
