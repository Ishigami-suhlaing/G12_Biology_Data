"Biodiversity comes from two words; Bio means life and diversity means variability",
  "The term 'Biodiversity' was coined by Walter G",
  "Rosen in  but was popularized by Edward O",
  "Wilson who is now known as 'Father of Biodiversity'",

  "The term 'biodiversity' refers to the variety and variability among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur",
  "Thus, biodiversity can be defined as the totality of genes, species and ecosystem of a region",
  "Biodiversity play a significant role in both human life and the natural ecosystem by maintaining the balance of the ecosystem",
  "Biodiversity can be defined as the degree of variation of life forms in an ecosystem",
  "This is usually taken to include diversity at three levels: the variation in ecosystems or habitats, the number of different species in the ecosystem and their relative abundance,the genetic variation within each species ",
  "Levels of Biodiversity ÔÇßAn ecosystem is a community of organisms and their physical environment interacting each other's together",
  "The diversity of ecological complexity includes variations in ecological niches, trophic structure, food-webs and nutrient cycling etc",
  "The ecosystems also show variations with respect to physical parameters like moisture, temperature, altitude, precipitation etc",
  "Many ecosystems like deserts, rainforests and mangroves etc., exhibit a vast diversity of life forms residing in their respective ecosystems",
  "Thus, there occurs tremendous diversity within the ecosystem, along these gradients",
  "Species diversity is defined as the number of species and abundance of each species that lives in a particular location",
  "The number of species in a community is known as species richness",
  "Species diversity not only considers richness, but also includes a measure of the evenness of the abundance of the different species",
  "The more species there are, and the more evenly the numbers of organisms are distributed among the different species and the greater the species diversity",
  "Coral reefs have a very high biodiversity; such an ecosystem offers many different ecological niches, which are exploited by different species",
  "Species diversity is considered important because ecosystems with high species diversity tend to be more stable than ones with limited diversity, they are more able to resist changes",
  "Genetic diversity refers to the variety of genetic information contained in all of the individual plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms",
  "Genetic diversity is the variety of genes within a species",
  "The genetic diversity that exists between varieties of cultivated plants and domesticated animals is obvious",
  "Similar genetic diversity, although not always so obvious, exists in natural populations",
  "The genetic differences between populations of the same species exist because populations may be adapted slightly differences in different parts of their ranges",
  "There is also genetic diversity within each population",
  "This diversity is important in providing populations with the ability to adapt to changes in biotic and abiotic factors, such as competition with other species, evading new predators, resisting new strains of disease and changes in temperature, salinity, humidity and rainfall",
  "Biodiversity is very important for the well-being of our planet, human health, food security, economy and livelihoods",
  "All organisms in an ecosystem live in interdependence sharing living space, shelter and available food",
  "They can affect the physical conditions around them",
  "Rich biodiversity allows large-scale ecosystems to function and self-regulate",
  "These ecosystems are also interlinked on a large scale across the earth",
  "If biodiversity is reduced in one area, the natural balance may be destroyed elsewhere",
  "Healthy ecosystem and rich biodiversity will: (a) increase ecosystem productivity; each species in an ecosystem has a specific niche which is a role to play (b) support a larger number of plant species and, therefore, a greater variety of crops (c) protect fresh water resources (d) promote soil formation and protection  (e) provide nutrient storage and recycling (f)aid in breaking down pollutants  (g) contribute to climate stability (h) speed recovery from natural disasters (i)provide more food resources (j)provide more medicinal resources and pharmaceutical drugs",
  "Myanmar is the largest country in mainland Southeast Asia with a land area of , ùê§ùê¶",
  "Because of its size, its large latitudinal range of , km, and the diversity of its topography and habitats, the country is rich in biological diversity (biodiversity)",
  "Myanmar spans a vast area and has diverse geographical features and climates from tropical coral reefs to alpine habitats",
  "Forests cover ranges from moist tropical rain forests in the south, through dry deciduous forests in central areas to temperate broad leaf and alpine forests toward the north",
  "The diverse habitats are home for a wide range of species",
  "Forest ecosystems are a carbon sink and stabilize soils",
  "By slowing water flow due to increased infiltration, forests help regulates the seasonal flow of water downstream and recharge sources of groundwater, which supports base flow in streams",
  "People living downstream benefit from increased stream flows during the dry season, thereby improving access to water for drinking, irrigation and freshwater fisheries etc",
  "By impeding the loss of soils, forests help to maintain the functioning of dam and reservoir infrastructure",
  "Forest constitutes the dominant vegetation type in Myanmar as shown in Table ",
  "The total area of forest is , ùê§ùê¶ which is % of the total land area",
  "However, only half of this is described as closed forest, whereas the other half is 'open' or 'degraded\"",
  "Rainfall and elevation strongly influence the distribution of different vegetation types",
  "Dry forest occurs where rainfall is usually less than  mm a year and support xerophytic types of vegetation (Table .)",
  "The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) publishes the Red Data Book, which includes the list of endangered species of plants and animals",
  "The red data symbolizes the warning signal for those species, which are endangered and if not protected are likely to become extinct in near future",
  "Endangered Species ÔÇßMyanmar is moderately biodiverse country with many species of trees, shrubs, flowering plants, grasses, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, fungi and micro- organisms",
  "About  mammal species, more than , birds,  reptiles and , plants are recorded in Myanmar, among them  species of mammals,  of birds,  of reptiles and  of plants are globally threatened",
  "Biodiversity ensures natural sustainability for all life on the earth, for example, abundant crops and fresh air",
  "More than 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity, while more than 1.6 billion people rely on forests for their livelihoods",
  "The loss of biodiversity affects the lives of more than  1 billion people living in dry lands",
  "Biodiversity is under threat in many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as the human population continues to increase and taking more resources from the environment which produce increasing quantities of waste",
  "Ecosystems and species are being lost at an alarming rate, not just by the direct action of humans, but also indirectly as a result of climate change",
  "Habitat destruction has played a key role in extinction",
  "The destruction of the natural environment leads to habitat loss",
  "The clearing of land for agriculture, housing, transport, leisure facilities and industry removes vegetation",
  "Consequently, many species of plants and animals are either lose their habitats completely or their habitats become divided into small areas",
  "This is known as habitat fragmentation",
  "Factors causing habitat destruction are overpopulation, deforestation, pollution and global warming",
  "Habitat size and number of species are systematically related",
  "Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area",
  "However, most cultivation employs techniques that can significantly degrade the natural environment",
  "For example, shifting cultivation in upland areas, gold mining, urbanization and the clearance of natural forests for agricultural expansion and so on ",
  "Mining causes deterioration of aquatic ecosystems ÔÇßHabitat loss occurs when natural environments are transformed or modified to serve human needs",
  "It is the most significant cause of biodiversity loss globally",
  "For example, deforestation, damming rivers and so on ",
  "A variety of human activities threatens the agrobiodiversity of Myanmar",
  "Factors such as the replacement of local landraces with modern varieties, agricultural area expansion, overgrazing, dams and canal construction and urbanization are major threats to the agrobiodiversity of Myanmar ",
  "Pollution (soil, water or air) is a growing threat on both land and in aquatic ecosystems",
  "Pollution is caused by uncontrolled pesticide and herbicide uses, various factory wastes, different kinds of rubbish, human sewage, radioactive materials and industrial wastes ",
  "Little is known about the status of invasive alien species in Myanmar, but a few IAS have been observed in the country",
  "IAS can also be introduced unintentionally by tourists or through the transport of cargo or movement of pets, plant parts and seeds",
  "Some may be intentionally imported for use in research, manufacture of medicine or ornamental and industrial uses ",
  "Genetic pollution indicates the loss of identity of wild plant species as a result of transfer of genes from crop plants, with engineered fitness genes causing special concern",
  "However, significant reproductive barriers exist between most wild species and crop plants",
  "Gene flow is expected to have its greatest effect on weed species that are closely related to crop plants taxonomically, ecologically and in their reproductive biology",
  "Genetic Pollution ÔÇßThe introduction of genetically engineered (GE) organisms into the complex ecosystems of our environment is a dangerous global experiment with nature and evolution",
  "Genetic pollution is undesirable gene flow into wild populations",
  "The term is usually associated with the gene flow from a genetically engineered (GE) organism (or genetically modified organism - GMO) to a non- GE organism",
  "\"Genetic pollution\" and collateral damage from GE field crops already have begun to wreak environmental havoc",
  "Wind, rain, birds, bees, and insect pollinators have begun carrying genetically altered pollen into adjoining fields, polluting the DNA of crops of organic and non-GE farmers",
  "Once released, it is virtually impossible to recall genetically engineered organisms back to the laboratory or the field",
  "Overexploitation, also called overharvesting, can lead to the destruction of the resource, as it will be unable to replenish",
  "The term applies to natural resources such as water aquifers, grazing pastures and forests, wild medicinal plants, fish stocks and other wildlife",
  "Overexploitation ÔÇßOverfishing is the removal of a species of fish (i.e",
  "fishing) from a body of water at a rate greater than that the species can replenish its population naturally",
  "Overfishing can occur in water bodies of any sizes, such as ponds, wetlands, rivers, lakes or oceans, and can result in resource depletion, reduced biological growth rates and low biomass levels",
  "Overlogging is a form of overexploitation caused by legal or illegal logging activities that lead to unsustainable or irrecoverable deforestation and permanent habitat destruction for forest wildlife",
  "Overhunting threatens one-third of endangered vertebrates, as well as other groups",
  "Excluding edible fish, the illegal trade in wildlife is valued at $ billion per year",
  "As of ,  terrestrial mammals were threatened with extinction due to hunting for bushmeat including primates, even-toed ungulates, bats, diprotodontid marsupials, rodents and carnivores occurring in developing countries",
  "Bushmeat provides increased opportunity for transmission of several zoonotic viruses from animal hosts to humans, such as Ebola virus and HIV",
  "Climate change is a growing threat to biodiversity",
  "It alters the climate patterns and ecosystems in which species have evolved and on which they depend",
  "For example, rising ocean temperatures and diminishing Arctic sea ice affects marine biodiversity and can shift vegetation zones, having global implications",
  "Overall, climate is a major factor in the distribution of species across the globe; climate change forces them to adjust",
  "But many are not able to cope, causing them to become extinct ",
  " It is only logical that an increase in the world's population will cause additional strains on resources",
  "More people increased demand for food, water, housing, energy, healthcare, transportation, and more",
  "And all that consumption contributes to ecological degradation, increased conflicts, and a higher risk of large-scale disasters like pandemics",
  "Human Overpopulation ÔÇßAn increase in population will inevitably create pressures leading to more deforestation, decreased biodiversity, and spikes in pollution and emissions, which will exacerbate climate change",
  "Ultimately, unless we take action to help minimize further population growth heading into the remainder of this century, many scientists believe the additional stress on the planet will lead to ecological disruption and collapse so severe it threatens the viability of life on Earth, as we know it",
  "Wildlife trade refers to the commerce of products that are derived from non-domesticated animals or plants usually extracted from their natural environment or raised under controlled conditions",
  "It can involve the trade of living or dead individuals, tissues such as skins, bones, feathers, meat, or other products of wild plants and wild animals",
  "Wildlife trade can be differentiated in legal and illegal trade, and both can have domestic (local or national) or international markets that involve products travelling across the world to different countries",
  "Illegal wildlife trade contributes directly to the loss of species and habitat destruction, but it also directly and indirectly impacts local communities",
  "Recent overexploitation of wildlife for trade has affected countless species for example pangolins, tigers, rhinoceroses, elephants, monkeys and others",
  "High demand from expanding illegal wildlife markets in neighboring countries is rapidly threatening the endangered wildlife of Myanmar",
  "In wildlife smuggling or trafficking, the products demanded by the trade include exotic pets, food, traditional medicine, clothing, and jewelry made from animals' tusks, fins, skins, shells, horns, and internal organs",
  "Smuggled wildlife is an increasing global demand",
  "Much of demand for rhinoceros' horns, tiger bones, and other animal products arises out of the practice of traditional Chinese medicine, which uses these ingredients to treat fevers, gout, and other illnesses; maintain good health and longevity; and enhance sexual potency ",
  "Firing the elephant ivory recovered from poachers  ",
  "Confiscated animal pelts from the illegal wildlife trade ÔÇßHowever, the most trafficked animal in the world is the pangolin, accounting for as much as % of all illegal wildlife trade",
  "Pangolins are the only scaly mammal on earth",
  "In the last decade, more than one million pangolins were poached and killed for their scales",
  "The pangolin trade is the illegal poaching, trafficking, and sale of pangolins, parts of pangolins, or pangolin-derived products on the black market",
  "The animals are trafficked mainly for their scales, which are believed to be effective in treating a variety of health conditions",
  "Though meat and scales are the primary drivers of the intercontinental pangolin trade, there are also other less common parts and uses .)",
  "Wildlife smuggling directly affects the biodiversity of different ecosystems",
  "Certain animals are in higher demand by smugglers and leading to a visible decline of these species in their native habitats",
  "Wildlife smuggling may also cause the introduction of invasive and harmful species into an ecosystem, which can endanger indigenous wildlife by putting a strain on the environment's resources through interspecific competition between species",
  "Therefore, wildlife trade is a serious conservation problem, has a negative effect on the viability of many wildlife populations and one of the major threats to the survival of vertebrate species",
  "The illegal wildlife trade has been linked to the emergence and spread of new infectious diseases in humans, including emergent viruses",
  "Outbreaks of zoonotic diseases including COVID -, ùêáùêç, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and monkeypox have been traced to live wildlife markets where the potential for zoonotic transmission is greatly increased",
  "There are certain places in the world where wildlife trade is particularly threatening or where targeted action would be particularly worthwhile",
  "These places are called ‚Äòwildlife trade hotspots‚Äô",
  "Therefore, national and international laws are in place for wildlife protection, such as CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna), and Conservation of Biodiversity and Protected Areas Law () in Myanmar",
  "Biodiversity is being reduced through human activities such as overexploitation, deforestation, habitat destruction, pollution and as a result of climate change",
  "However, many people around the world are working hard to reduce these trends and to conserve the biodiversity we still have",
  "This can be tackled in many different ways",
  "Conservation means keeping and protecting a living and changing environment",
  "It is an active process involving an enormous range of projects",
  "In order to keep the beauty and diversity of nature reserves, it is important to manage it effectively",
  "Active intervention is required to restore areas and to protect native species, and sustainable benefits for the present as well as future strategies",
  "Biodiversity is important and should be conserved for its values and benefits to human health and well-beings",
  "The followings are the three major reasons to conserve biodiversity:  i.Narrowly Utilitarian: The useful human products like food, fibres, drugs and medicines are obtained from biodiversity",
  "ii.Broadly Utilitarian: Biodiversity provides ecosystem services like providing oxygen, pollinating crops and controlling floods, erosions, etc",
  "iii.Ethical Utilitarian: Every living species has an intrinsic value, though it may not have direct economic value and every species has the right to live",
  "There are mainly two conservation methods; in situ and ex situ conservation methods",
  "Conservation Methods ÔÇßIn situ methods are the ways of conservation of species which take place in the natural habitat of the organism",
  "The best way to conserve any species is to keep it in its natural habitat",
  "Maintaining the natural habitat means that all the \"life support systems\" are provided",
  "In situ conservation methods ÔÇßNature reserves such as wildlife sanctuary, national park and biosphere reserve help endangered species by maintaining their habitat and genetic diversity, defending the target species from predators and preventing competition from invasive species",
  "Keeping these organisms' in situ means putting them in the ecosystem where they belong",
  "As a result of this, the target species can continue to adapt to conditions in the reserve without interference from outside influences",
  "Active management of nature reserves involves;continuous monitoring, maintenance of effective boundaries, measures to facilitate the successful completion of life cycles and  () restocking and reintroducing of once-common species from stocks produced by captive breeding programmes of zoological and botanical gardens",
  "Ex situ conservation methods ÔÇßEx situ, methods are the ways to conserve animals and plants outside their natural habitats",
  "It is not always possible to conserve animal species in the wild because the conditions that have put them under threat of extinction",
  "Zoos and wildlife parks used to exist just for people to look at the animals, but today they are very important in animal conservation by ex situ conservation methods",
  "These methods are usually used as a last resort",
  "The three methods of ex situ conservation are captive breeding of animals, storage of seeds in the seed bank and cultivation of plants in botanical garden",
  "Ex situ conservation methods Captive breeding ÔÇßEndangered species typically have very low population numbers and are in serious danger of becoming extinct",
  "For some species whose numbers have dwindled drastically, captive breeding may be their last hope of survival",
  "In captive breeding programmes, individuals of an endangered species are bred in zoos and parks in an attempt to save the species from extinction",
  "Usually, the ultimate aim is to reintroduce the captive-bred animals into the wild to restore the original populations",
  "Reintroduction does not always work, but it can programme to be successful in national parks or other protected areas",
  "Some techniques used in captive breeding programmes are: i.Artificial insemination ii.Embryo transfer to a surrogate mother iii.Cryogenics (eggs, sperm cells and embryos can be frozen for future use)  iv.Human-raised young v.Keeping a pedigree (prevent from inbreeding)  Problems with captive breeding and reintroduction programmes are: i.not enough space or resources in zoos and parks for all the endangered species ii.difficulty in providing the right conditions for breeding, even if scientists know what those conditions are iii.continuation of the conditions that pushed the species close to extinction iv.animals that have been bred in captivity may have problems adjusting to unsupported life in the wild v.reintroduction programmes can be very expensive and time consuming and they may be fail ÔÇßIt has been estimated that % of the world's flowering plant species could disappear within the next  years",
  "There are thought to be about , species of flowering plants now, so this would mean , species disappearing in less than one human lifetime",
  "Seed banks have been set up to help conserve rare plant species",
  "Seeds in a seed bank are kept in cold, dark conditions in which the metabolism of the seed slows down so the seed is prevented from germinating ",
  "Seed bank Seed bank ÔÇßThe storage of seeds is one of the most widespread and valuable ex situ approaches to conservation",
  "Seed banks protect and save plant genetic diversity, which is important for a number of reasons",
  "These saved and viable seeds contain a treasure trove of useful genes that breeders can use for developing improved varieties of our major food crops",
  "For example: i.Improve resistance to current and emerging plant diseases and insects ii.Provide drought or flood tolerance iii.Improve yields and nutrition to feed a growing global population ÔÇßPlants are easily kept in captivity",
  "About , plant species are grown in private gardens, arboretums and botanical gardens all over the world",
  "Botanical gardens also have an important role in the preservation of species necessary for human use and well-being",
  "These gardens are good locations for many branches of scientific research",
  "Botanical gardens not only serve as taxonomic and systematic research centers but they play an important role as valuable sources of plant ecology",
  "Botanical garden Gardens by the Bay ÔÇßOne of the major objectives of botanical gardens is to create and support collections of native taxa, and to build and maintain stocks of plants for ex situ conservation and sustainable utilization of plant resources in the world",
  "Botanical gardens are also ideal places to integrate the study and conservation of trees species that are endangered in the wild",
  "Protected areas (PAs) are important tools for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development",
  "PAs are safeguard ecosystems and their services, such as water provision, food production, carbon sequestration and climate regulation, thus improving people's livelihoods",
  "They preserve the integrity of spiritual and cultural values placed by indigenous people on wild areas and offer opportunities of inspiration, study and recreation",
  "Protected Areas in Myanmar  In Myanmar,  protected areas have been established as following categories: -Scientific reserve -National park -Marine national park -Nature reserve  -Wildlife sanctuary  -Community forest ÔÇßScientific reserve has some similarities to nature reserves",
  "They are held for the protection of their features (including flora and fauna) for \"scientific study, research, education, and the benefit of the country\" e.g., Tanintharyi Nature Reserve .)",
  "Tanintharyi Nature Reserve ÔÇßA national park is an area set aside by a national government for the preservation of the natural environment",
  "It is maintained for biodiversity conservation and representativeness and firm management control",
  "No settlement or resource harvesting is allowed",
  "A marine park is a permanent marine reservation for the conservation of species",
  "It constitutes an extension, to the undersea world, of the concept of the terrestrial national park",
  "It is the same as national park but in marine, island and coastal environments e.g, Lampi Island Marine National Park .)",
  "Nature reserve is a protected area of importance for flora, fauna, or features of geological or other special interest, which is reserved and managed for purposes of conservation and to provide special opportunities for study or research e.g., Popa Mountain Park, Hkakaborazi National Park .)",
  "A wildlife sanctuary is an area where animal habitats and their surroundings are protected from any sort of disturbance",
  "The capturing, killing and poaching of animals is strictly prohibited in these regions",
  "They aim at providing a comfortable living to the animals e.g., Hlawga Park, Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary ",
  "In the early s, the Government of Myanmar introduced Community forest (CF) as a way to protect endangered forest resources and support the subsistence needs of rural communities",
  "Community forest means all sustainable forest management and utilization activities, in which the local community itself is involved",
  "This expression includes establishing new plantations and managing existing forests, creating employment and income opportunities for subsistence to commercial purposes, generating food, stabilizing ecosystems, and improving the environmental conditions",
  "Community forests are an important tool for biodiversity conservation and sustainable community-driven development .)"
